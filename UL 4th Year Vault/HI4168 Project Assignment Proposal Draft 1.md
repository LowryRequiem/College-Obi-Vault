# Project Proposal

The Coote family are prominent figures in early developing Ireland given their roles as landlords over Ballyfin house and estate and many lands and towns within county Laois. 

The Coote Papers archive contains a large collection of early twentieth-century correspondences and accounts held by the Coote family, sets of deeds, letters of administration and extensive grazing and letting agreements. 

This project aims to look at the Coote Papers archival collection and analyse them to gain insight on class relations within estate management and plantations, and how the Coote family elevated their status in becoming landlords of towns such as Mountrath and Maryborough (now Portlaoise). 

In doing so, this project aims to look at how class affected the development of these areas, and to look at the Coote's class relations and dynamic with the tenants and residence of the lands in question. 

Many towns and lands in Ireland owe their initial development to the external influence of Britain, and while the Laois/Offaly plantation was not as extensive as the likes of the Munster or Ulster plantations, this project hopes to highlight the significance of this in the further development of these lands under the guidance of land owners such as the Coote family.

The Coote family entered into the hierarchy of Ireland through Sir Charles Coote who obtained one of the first baronetcies in Ireland for his service to the crown during the Nine Years War. He founded the town of Mountrath in county Laois and thus his lineage held the titles of Earl of Mountrath until 1802 when the title became extinct, making Charles Henry Coote the 7th Earl of Mountrath. The title, Baron Castlecoote, would get passed to a distant cousin, Charles Henry Coote, in Dublin, allowing him to also inherit the 7th Earl of Mountrath's properties. 

Ballyfin was sold to this Charles Coote by Wellesley-Pole in 1813. Charles Coote would begin rebuilding Ballyfin on a magnificent scale. Descendant Ralph Coote would later sell the Ballyfin estate in the 1920s as Irish Independence hastened the demise of the Big House. Ballyfin would later be purchased by the Patrician Brothers who ran a school from the estate until 2002. The estate was then purchased by Fred and Kay Krehbiel, who would partner with Jim Reynolds to form Ballyfin Demesne Ltd. and restore the house into a hotel after a nine-year restoration project in 2011.

The Coote papers themselves contain a variety of deeds, letters and administrative notes which allow us to gather insight into the management of the estates and lands at the time. Many of the correspondence displays the routine elements to estate management with reports and repairs of facilities such as roofs and piping. These then range to land deeds for plots of ground around Portlaoise, and hand drawn maps of surveyed estates. There is an extensive array of information within the Cootes papers which allow us to uncover details of the financial side of estate management. These papers also give general insight into how the Cootes ran these estates, and therefore allow us to explore the dynamic in class structure between the Cootes as landowners and the tenants and those who occupied the lands of Maryborough, Mountrath and other lands mentioned within these papers. 

Ultimately, this project sets out to analyse the Cootes history in relation to both Ballyfin house and estate and the lands owned and managed by the Cootes as shown throughout their papers archive. The aim of doing this is to see how a family like the Cootes, granted into the hierarchy of Irish landowners through service to the crown, managed their estates and what this says for their relation with class relations at the time. This will allow us to explore the effect of planted areas such as Laois on the locality and development over these centuries, and how the influence of Britain is demonstrated through the land ownerships granted to families such as the Cootes.
