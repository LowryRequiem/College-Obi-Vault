## Colin Barrett Diamonds response

I found Diamonds to be a very intriguing and encapsulating read. The use of first person narration throughout made for both a incredibly vivid and descriptive text but also a calculated dive into the psyche of the protagonist. Being able to process the narrators thoughts through his descriptions and recollections of different events allows us as readers to understand where they are at in a given situation and throughout Diamonds our understanding of the narrator broadens as he descriptively deciphers through different environments. His interactions with people in particular stand out, with him always feeling detached and distant from other characters in the text despite being involved in close, intimate scenes with them. This holds true for his perception of the world around him in general, and is told naturally throughout the text. These techniques allow diamonds to explore many complex themes through just the protagonists narration such as addiction, self-destruction, escapism and isolation.

# Character Analysis Assignment (150 Words)

The characters I have chosen which intrigued me are the dual protagonists of the novel, "This is How You Lose the Time War" by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone. The protagonists are named simply Red and Blue, and the narrative see’s the pair communicating across time as they each work for opposing organisations in a war led by time travel. I’ve chosen these characters as their development is the driving force of the narrative and is done in a subtle complex way. With Red being a dominant and aggressive person, characterized by commitment and discipline, and Blue being a curious and creative person, driven by individuality, the pair are complete contrasts to each other. Despite this, as their relationship is expanded upon throughout the narrative, their conflicting personalities result in a huge amount of growth for both of them, Red seeing the potential of transformation and growth whereas Blue learns to understand capacity for change. The way in which the narrative explores this immense personal transformation through polar opposite characters, reinforced by the naming conventions of Red and Blue, makes these protagonists incredibly interesting to observe throughout the text.
