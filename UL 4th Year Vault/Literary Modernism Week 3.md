# Class notes

T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" and "The Waste Land" are two iconic poems that exemplify literary modernism. Here's a concise case study on each of them:

**1. "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" (1915):**

**Context:** "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" was published during the early 20th century, a time when literary modernism was emerging as a reaction to the societal changes and disillusionment brought about by World War I. Eliot's poem reflects the fragmented and uncertain nature of this era.

**Key Themes and Characteristics:**

- **Alienation and Urban Life:** The poem portrays the inner thoughts of J. Alfred Prufrock, a hesitant and neurotic figure who struggles with self-doubt and alienation in the context of modern urban life. Prufrock is disconnected from his surroundings and feels like an outsider.
    
- **Fragmentation and Stream of Consciousness:** Eliot employs a fragmented narrative and stream-of-consciousness technique to reflect Prufrock's disjointed thoughts and the chaotic nature of his inner world. The poem doesn't follow a linear narrative structure, mirroring the disorienting experience of modernity.
    
- **Cultural and Artistic References:** Eliot makes numerous references to art, literature, and culture, showcasing the influence of high culture on modernist writing. These references contribute to the poem's complexity and invite readers to engage with a range of intertextual meanings.
    
- **Search for Identity:** Prufrock's constant questioning and self-doubt underscore the modernist theme of the search for identity in a rapidly changing world. He grapples with issues of self-worth, aging, and the fear of rejection.
    

**2. "The Waste Land" (1922):**

**Context:** "The Waste Land" is often regarded as one of the most significant works of literary modernism. It was written in the aftermath of World War I, a time of profound disillusionment and cultural upheaval, and it reflects the shattered worldview of the era.

**Key Themes and Characteristics:**

- **Desolation and Fragmentation:** The poem is characterized by a sense of desolation and fragmentation, both in its form and content. It weaves together multiple voices, languages, and cultural references, creating a fractured and disorienting narrative.
    
- **Mythology and Cultural Allusions:** Eliot draws upon a wide range of mythological, literary, and religious references, blending them to create a collage of cultural voices. This technique reflects the disillusionment of the time and suggests that traditional cultural frameworks no longer provide meaningful guidance.
    
- **Spiritual Crisis:** "The Waste Land" explores a profound spiritual crisis and a sense of cultural and moral decay. It portrays a world in which traditional values have eroded, leaving individuals spiritually adrift.
    
- **Hope Amidst Desolation:** Despite the bleakness of the poem, there are moments of hope and the possibility of redemption. Eliot suggests that renewal and salvation are possible, but they require a deep inner transformation and a willingness to confront the harsh realities of the modern world.
    

Both of these poems exemplify the characteristics of literary modernism, such as fragmented narratives, cultural references, and a deep exploration of the individual's place in a rapidly changing society. They reflect the complexity and uncertainty of the modernist era and continue to be studied and celebrated for their innovative use of language and themes.

Close readings important for *final essay task*

## What are the characteristics of Modernism?

Going against the norm
Influences of *WW1* **poets before vs after WW1** Poetry produced from catastrophe is unlike anything outside of that
*Dulce e decorum est*

Underlines the principles of the *enlightenment* **which rested on the assumptions that the more we think the more civilized we become** WW1 as a bold example that this was not the case

Open ended ness *loss of resolution* **reader has to do a load of work**

## Why is Heart of Darkness a modernist text?

Early modernist text *Joseph Conrad Heart of Darkness* 
### Opening, Mood & Setting

Melancholic, unsettling, foreboding mood *disorientating*
Control taken away, *journey entirely reliant by elements outside of your control* **any idea of being a captain of your own ship is over swept by modernism in the opening**

Sight is often obscured in *Heart of Darkness* **what you see is not what you get**

No ends to it, stuck in their situation, no moving forward or back

Sight limited by *haze*

Heart of Darkness is made appear to be Africa *but from the start it is suggested that the Heart of Darkness is actually in the West* **its the imperialist, colonial concept that is the heart of darkness**

#### River Thames

Two voyages mentioned taking off from the Thames, *Francis Drake mentioned* **Francis Drake was a pirate essentially that looted Spanish ships** 
Implied that all journeys set out from the Thames aren't necessarily honest expeditions *thievery of resources*

## Charming; the Snake / River

Viewing Africa/ the river as the dangerous hostile snake, and himself as the bird *yet its described to have an allure to it* **in the western mind, the east has always occupied a place of fantasy, its frightening but attractive** 
place of otherness in the west, *the west has 'ordinary civilised' lives* **drawn to the dangerous of the east**

Representation of the African woman at the end of the text *very western way of looking at others culture* **western presence is colonial presence**

## Introduction to Marlow

Boat can't move, sun is setting, listening to a story *invokes the power of storytelling as Marlow's voice has a presence within the stillness*

Visually described as a man who's been through a journey *different aura to the rest of them* **becomes an amalgamation of both cultures**

### Marlow's First Words

"And this also, has been one of the dark places in the world"

#### Stories

The stories tradition people tell have a direct simplicity, *shell with a nut inside, the nut is the meaning* **presented with something you can figure out and derive meaning from it**

Whereas with Marlow *the mean of the episode was not inside like a kernel but outside* **exploring the tale as a glow brings out a haze**

Conrad is not trying to show one meaning

#### Intentional vagueness

Explicitness, is fatal to the glamour of all artistic work *robbing of all suggestiveness* **intentionally vague, by moving the reader away from assumption**

Meaning is in the scene, how the imagery is set

## Pro or Anti-Colonial

Filtered colonial perspective *operating as an outsider in both spheres* 
Notable criticisms by *Chunua Achebe* **racism in the Heart of Darkness**

The text does argue against colonialism *but also dehumanizes Africans*
