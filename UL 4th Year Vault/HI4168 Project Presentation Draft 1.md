## Slide 1.1

Introduction to the topic; The socio-economic repercussions of the Coote family's estate management of Mountrath and Ballyfin and what legacy remains?

-

My presentation is on the socio-economic repercussions of the Cootes family estate management of Mountrath and Ballyfin.

The Coote family were landowners in Laois who most notably founded Mountrath, Maryborough (now Portlaoise) and reconstructed the Ballyfin estate, most notably producing Ballyfin house - which stands now as a luxury hotel
## Slide 1.2

My own relation to the topic - being from Mountrath - knowing Ballyfin house - MCS - being a living person who can both see and feel the repercussions of these developments

-

I went with this topic as I'm from Mountrath and have pretty personal relations to all these things the Coote left as their legacy. For one, the Patrician brothers who are affiliated with MCS previously ran school out of Ballyfin house, and this is something I've become very used to hearing about, meeting people who worked their both past and present. On top of that, being someone from Mountrath, and spending a lot of my life in and around Portlaoise, I was automatically interested in the founding's of these places and believe its important to understand this and be able to appreciate how the legacy of this one family spelled generations of work and relations in and around these towns.

A Coote History

-

The history of the Cootes involvement in Ireland begins with Sir Charles Coote who founded Mountrath in 1628, after being granted baronetcies from the crown for his service in the Nine Years War. (Special Coll) 

The title Earl of Mountrath would be granted to his son, also Charles Coote, in 1660 and would continue to pass on through the family until 1802. (Special Coll)

The Cootes would continue to establish a landed interest in Queens Country, with Charles Henry Coote representing both Queens County and Maryborough in 1770s and 80s, and Sir Eyre Coote garnering increasing fame and fortune in the 80s for his service in India as a British army commander. Their support of union would land them the title Baron Castlecoote, upon loosing the title Earl of Mountrath. (D flemming)

## Slide 2.2

Ballyfin House origins - Pre Coote history until Cootes get it *points about Class - their royal affiliations and how this is shown through the development of the estate*

-

The site of Ballyfin has passed through several hands before reaching the Cootes, the O'Mores, Crosbys, the Wellesley Poles the family of the Duke of Wellington and then later the Cootes.

The O'More clan claimed and held the territory during medieval ages, until it was later weakened and dissolved during the Laois Offaly plantation 1549. (ballyfin rebuilt)

It isn't until later that Ballyfin is raised to the status of demesne. The lands were purchased by Sir Piers Crosby at the beginning of the 1600s, yet he would have to forfeit them during the reign of Cromwell and the Commonwealth. It is then in 1637 that Ballyfin is raised to manorial status and established as a local power base. (ballyfin rebuilt)

As Irish lands shifted ownership at the end of the seventeenth century and the Protestant Ascendancy began to thrive, Ballyfin saw much evolution as a result. Initially with  Pole family who would bring Ballyfin into being an acclaimed demesne. Throughout the early 1700s, the poles would transform Ballyfin from castle to a mansion house with particular expanse on the gardens. Throughout this period, though it is uncertain when, the house was burnt in a fire and rebuilt. The survival of early-Georgian joinery and chimneypieces suggest that the rebuilding happened before the death of Periam Pole in 1748, as his brother would refine the house with more neo-classical works in the 1770s.
## Slide 2.3

Cootes activities with the house, what did they do and why did they do *more class, lavish lifestyle etc.*

-

Ballyfin would be acquired by Sir Charles Henry Coote after he inherited the baronetcy and estate of his cousin and namesake, the 7th and last Early of Mountrath in 1802. This provided him suitable residence for his new landed estate. 

The Cootes were known to be ambitious and adventurous dynasty through the 1700s and so them acquiring Ballyfin appeared to be a happy coincidence. 

Sir Charles Cootes acquiring of 50,000 acres of land, and coming of age at the time of Ballyfin sale all worked out perfectly. Having realised that the Cootes never left an architectural stamp on any of their owned lands across Ireland, he set out to remedy this.

The house was initially described as having a grand neatness but very little in magnificence. The decision to remodel came in 1821, and after an initial failure, the architectural partnership of Richard and William Vitruvius Morrison was employed to take over where they would produce one of Irelands great neo-classical houses.


## Slide 2.4

Post Cootes acquisitions, Patrician brothers, Hotel *legacy and effect on culture and tourism as a result of the class stuff*

So after much trial and error, the Cootes managed to raise Ballyfin to the luxurious standard we associate it with. The Cootes have left not much outside material legacy when analysing their life in Ballyfin. Sir Charles was occupied with the business of handling a landed estate. They did throw large house parties. Charles involvement in parliment kept them in the loop at London, and their travels too acted as a reminder of their position.

An extensive fire in 1846, 1848 famine took their only daughter Caroline de Massingy. As a result of both these occurances, Lady Caroline had the Gold Room expensivly redecorated while Sir Chalres erected a great stone tower overlooking the demesne. 

After the famine, Coote would aquire the rest of Wellsely Poles estate garnering anohter 8000 acres of land.

Sir Charles Coote is described as a committed improver, of both his demesne and his estates. When writer Thomas Carlyle proposed coming to Ireland Charles Coote was recommended to him as one of only six "really good" landlords

In his will, almost anticipating the neglect delivered by the next Sir Charles Coote, who barely visited, Coote had empowered his trustees in the event of negleect to take possession of the property and rests so as to ensure that the 'mansion house, demesne gardens, pleasure grounds, out offices and other appurtenances' were maintained in the same state as "have been kept up by me"

The hierarchy of servants within Ballyfin was dictated based on gender and role, with the butler George Clements at the beginning of the 1900s looming as one of the larger figures at Ballyfin, with his approval sought for all household matters.

In the period between 1816 and 1830 there were approx 30 people on the Ballyfin payroll, which amounted anually to around 750 pound. Half were female, half were male. The paternal interest of the Cootes over this wider family was repaid in mutual loyalty and friendship, with many of members of staff acknowledged in legacies, and all handsomly rewarded in his will.

## Slide 3.1

How the Cootes endeavours of the Ballyfin house has stood as a legacy landmark in Laois, it demonstrates itself as a bastion of restoration, tourism and a landmark of heritage in Laois

How people working at Ballyfin house and stuff demonstrates that penetration of class barrier and allows an affiliation their not often seen, people from Laois proud of stuff like that

After the death of the 12th Baronet in 1920, his son Ralph began to process of withdrawel. Tom Keegan was installed to caretake and safeguard the place throughout the era of sectarian disorder and civil war, Keegan had good sinn fein credentiallys and the estate survived. 

Ralph insisted that the demesne be kept intact at any cost, stating he'd rather let the place fall down before it be split up. and thus the entire demesne was passed to the Patrician brothers rather than the Irish Land Commission. three years later, all remaining tenanted lands were sold, and the cootes 300 year tenure in queens county came to an orderly end, precicsley 100 years after the 9th baronet had rebuilt ballyfin for residence.

The Patrician brothers immedialty set out to establish classrooms and dormitories. In the early days of the school the gardens were cultivated the lands were grazed etc. but as economic demands increased, expanse on the site began to intrude. The brothers were anwsering the demands placed on them of the needs of a larger school while preserving every facet of Ballyfin

It was in 2001 that the Patrician brothers announced their intention to close Ballyfin College. Three decades of slow decline had placed the house in a state of endangerment as it was just too much to upkeep. 

A fund raising campaign by the Irish Georgian society had highlighted the plight of the house but it was clear only an act of heroism could save the place

then in 2002, Chicago based couple Fred and Kay Krehbiel became the new owners of Ballyfin, and collaborated with Jim Reynolds, to restore the place with the intention of creating a luxury hotel with the primary focus being the restoration of the place. 

Advisory committee; Brother Maurice Murphy who had done what he could previously despite the needs of the school, Sir Christopher Coote, 15th Baronet and gret great great grandson of the builders of Ballyfin - Desmond Fitzgerald, Knight of Glin and President of the Irish Georgian soc, and several others who had interest in the preservation of the house. 

They set about re establishing the integrity of the house

among the team of architects was John J. O Connell who had led the restoration of Fota in Cork, another Morrisson House.
