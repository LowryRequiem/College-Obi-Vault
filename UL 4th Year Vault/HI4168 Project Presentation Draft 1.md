# Intro

## Slide 1.1

Introduction to the topic; The socio-economic repercussions of the Coote family's estate management of Mountrath and Ballyfin and what legacy remains?

-

My presentation is on the socio-economic repercussions of the Cootes family estate management of Mountrath and Ballyfin.

The Coote family were landowners in Laois who most notably founded Mountrath, Maryborough (now Portlaoise) and reconstructed the Ballyfin estate, most notably producing Ballyfin house - which stands now as a luxury hotel
## Slide 1.2

My own relation to the topic - being from Mountrath - knowing Ballyfin house - MCS - being a living person who can both see and feel the repercussions of these developments

-

I went with this topic as I'm from Mountrath and have pretty personal relations to all these things the Coote left as their legacy. For one, the Patrician brothers who are affiliated with MCS previously ran school out of Ballyfin house, and this is something I've become very used to hearing about, meeting people who worked their both past and present. On top of that, being someone from Mountrath, and spending a lot of my life in and around Portlaoise, I was automatically interested in the founding's of these places and believe its important to understand this and be able to appreciate how the legacy of this one family spelled generations of work and relations in and around these towns.

A Coote History

-

The history of the Cootes involvement in Ireland begins with Sir Charles Coote who founded Mountrath in 1628, after being granted baronetcies from the crown for his service in the Nine Years War. (Special Coll) 

The title Earl of Mountrath would be granted to his son, also Charles Coote, in 1660 and would continue to pass on through the family until 1802. (Special Coll)

The Cootes would continue to establish a landed interest in Queens Country, with Charles Henry Coote representing both Queens County and Maryborough in 1770s and 80s, and Sir Eyre Coote garnering increasing fame and fortune in the 80s for his service in India as a British army commander. Their support of union would land them the title Baron Castlecoote, upon loosing the title Earl of Mountrath. (D flemming)

## Slide 2.2

Ballyfin House origins - Pre Coote history until Cootes get it *points about Class - their royal affiliations and how this is shown through the development of the estate*

-

The site of Ballyfin has passed through several hands before reaching the Cootes, the O'Mores, Crosbys, the Wellesley Poles the family of the Duke of Wellington and then later the Cootes.

The O'More clan claimed and held the territory during medieval ages, until it was later weakened and dissolved during the Laois Offaly plantation 1549. (ballyfin rebuilt)

It isn't until later that Ballyfin is raised to the status of demesne. The lands were purchased by Sir Piers Crosby at the beginning of the 1600s, yet he would have to forfeit them during the reign of Cromwell and the Commonwealth. It is then in 1637 that Ballyfin is raised to manorial status and established as a local power base. (ballyfin rebuilt)

As Irish lands shifted ownership at the end of the seventeenth century and the Protestant Ascendancy began to thrive, Ballyfin saw much evolution as a result. Initially with  Pole family who would bring Ballyfin into being an acclaimed demesne. Throughout the early 1700s, the poles would transform Ballyfin from castle to a mansion house with particular expanse on the gardens. Throughout this period, though it is uncertain when, the house was burnt in a fire and rebuilt. The survival of early-Georgian joinery and chimneypieces suggest that the rebuilding happened before the death of Periam Pole in 1748, as his brother would refine the house with more neo-classical works in the 1770s.
## Slide 2.3

Cootes activities with the house, what did they do and why did they do *more class, lavish lifestyle etc.*

-

Ballyfin would be acquired by Sir Charles Henry Coote after he inherited the baronetcy and estate of his cousin and namesake, the 7th and last Early of Mountrath in 1802. This provided him suitable residence for his new landed estate. 

The Cootes were known to be ambitious and adventurous dynasty through the 1700s and so them acquiring Ballyfin appeared to be a happy coincidence. 

Sir Charles Cootes acquiring of 50,000 acres of land, and coming of age at the time of Ballyfin sale all worked out perfectly. Having realised that the Cootes never left an architectural stamp on any of their owned lands across Ireland, he set out to remedy this.

The house was initially described as having a grand neatness but very little in magnificence. The decision to remodel came in 1821, and after an initial failure, the architectural partnership of Richard and William Vitruvius Morrison was employed to take over where they would produce one of Irelands great neo-classical houses.
