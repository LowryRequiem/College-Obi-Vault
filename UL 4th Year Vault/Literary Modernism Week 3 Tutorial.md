# Intro

Close readings important for *final essay task*

## What are the characteristics of Modernism?

Going against the norm
Influences of *WW1* **poets before vs after WW1** Poetry produced from catastrophe is unlike anything outside of that
*Dulce e decorum est*

Underlines the principles of the *enlightenment* **which rested on the assumptions that the more we think the more civilized we become** WW1 as a bold example that this was not the case

Open ended ness *loss of resolution* **reader has to do a load of work**

## Why is Heart of Darkness a modernist text?

Early modernist text *Joseph Conrad Heart of Darkness* 
### Opening, Mood & Setting

Melancholic, unsettling, foreboding mood *disorientating*
Control taken away, *journey entirely reliant by elements outside of your control* **any idea of being a captain of your own ship is over swept by modernism in the opening**

Sight is often obscured in *Heart of Darkness* **what you see is not what you get**

No ends to it, stuck in their situation, no moving forward or back

Sight limited by *haze*

Heart of Darkness is made appear to be Africa *but from the start it is suggested that the Heart of Darkness is actually in the West* **its the imperialist, colonial concept that is the heart of darkness**

#### River Thames

Two voyages mentioned taking off from the Thames, *Francis Drake mentioned* **Francis Drake was a pirate essentially that looted Spanish ships** 
Implied that all journeys set out from the Thames aren't necessarily honest expeditions *thievery of resources*

## Charming; the Snake / River

Viewing Africa/ the river as the dangerous hostile snake, and himself as the bird *yet its described to have an allure to it* **in the western mind, the east has always occupied a place of fantasy, its frightening but attractive** 
place of otherness in the west, *the west has 'ordinary civilised' lives* **drawn to the dangerous of the east**

Representation of the African woman at the end of the text *very western way of looking at others culture* **western presence is colonial presence**

## Introduction to Marlow

Boat can't move, sun is setting, listening to a story *invokes the power of storytelling as Marlow's voice has a presence within the stillness*

Visually described as a man who's been through a journey *different aura to the rest of them* **becomes an amalgamation of both cultures**

### Marlow's First Words

"And this also, has been one of the dark places in the world"

#### Stories

The stories tradition people tell have a direct simplicity, *shell with a nut inside, the nut is the meaning* **presented with something you can figure out and derive meaning from it**

Whereas with Marlow *the mean of the episode was not inside like a kernel but outside* **exploring the tale as a glow brings out a haze**

Conrad is not trying to show one meaning

#### Intentional vagueness

Explicitness, is fatal to the glamour of all artistic work *robbing of all suggestiveness* **intentionally vague, by moving the reader away from assumption**

Meaning is in the scene, how the imagery is set

## Pro or Anti-Colonial

Filtered colonial perspective *operating as an outsider in both spheres* 
Notable criticisms by *Chunua Achebe* **racism in the Heart of Darkness**

The text does argue against colonialism *but also dehumanizes Africans*
