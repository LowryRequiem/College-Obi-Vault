## What is Modernism?

European and global phenomenon
Changes that took place in the arts between *1890-1930* , literature, drama, sculpture, music, architecture etc.
Sense of change and wanting to make things new in *early 20th century*
Dates note fixed, differ depending on art form

### Modernism and Cosmopolitanism

Cross-fusion of people/artists moving from place to place, *France, Britain*
Fusion of ideas and feelings of *estrangement* from moving away from home country, **feeling like an outsider - energising and new perspective on art**

**Paris** home for expatriate artists, *different language traditions - cross pollinations*

### Modernism and the modern

Modern *"current"*
A person who advocates or practises a *departure from traditional styles or values*, **what should a novel be? How should you live your life?**
*"Making it NEW"*  - Attempting to address changes in the world
Modernism as a movement *a pattern that emerges* which **foregrounds some artists and not others**
Implications that *if its modernism, it's good*

#### Characteristics of Modernism

Sense of deep historical and cultural crisis *both welcomed and feared*
Need for formal experimentation to address *historical and cultural crisis*, **art needs to change to accurately address the world**
An assumption that art is the **only place that can address these changes**
Associated with difficulty, *reader has to work to make sense of the text*

## Modernity

Stretches further than modernism, a way of *experiencing life*
A way of living in a world changed by *industrialisation, urbanisation, secularisation etc.* **different experience of what it felt like to be alive**
A relentless *change, loss and destabilization*
Changes in society in *mid 1800s*, **Science, philosophy and political thought**
Industrial / technological innovations

### Loss of perceived certainties about the world and our place in it

Darwin, *Origin of the species*, **the Bible and idea of creation**
Marx, *Capital*, **forecasts class revolution**
Freud, *Interpretation of Dreams*, **we are sway to unconscious desires**
Einstein, *Theory of Relativity*, **rethinking ideas of space and time**

#### Telephone, railway, motor car, airplane

World is speeding up and *shrinking* - **easier to travel and go places**


#### Marinetti - futurist manifesto

Magnificence of speed, worlds been *enriched by new beauty* - **celebration of the new**

#### Futurism

Artwork of *skyscrapers, metals etc.* 
Thrills of every day life

### Capitalism and the assembly line

Mechanization and automation
Henry Ford *first mass produced motor car in 1913* **every car produced the exact same, uniformity**
Workers *atomised* **cog in a machine, doing a bit for a bigger separate cause**
The control and the lack thereof, time consumption *clocking in clocking out* **senses within modernity of loss of individual control and everything speeding up**

### Urbanisation and the crowd

Consequences with how people live, *more likely to encounter people you don't know* **mixture of culture and classes**
Disrupting of the *old order*
Anonymity and alienation

#### Charles Baudelaire - A Une Passante (to a passer-by)

Deafening roaring street, *passes a woman mourning in majestic grief* **lightning flash, fleeting chance, eye contact on a glance**
Important moment, a moment present but far off, *You, whom I might have loved, who know it too* **Fleeting passing moment of intense significance but there's a loss because the moment is gone, city and crowd allows for this**
Moments of potential, *but things which don't follow through*, **melancholy**

### Technological Advances and risks of technology 

Titanic *1912*, **triumph of modernity turned disaster and terrible consequence**
World War 1 *1914 - 1918* **new technology leads to war on an industrial scale, tanks, zeppelins, nerve gas**

## Summary of Modernity

Characterised by *speed, shocks, new technology and crisis of knowledge* **Crisis and change = challenge AND opportunity**
Modernism, *attempts from the arts to address this change* **via formal experimentation**

## Literary Modernism

Early Modernism *1890s onwards* **Heart of Darkness**
High Modernism *1910 - 1930* **Imagist Poetry, Ulysses, The Wasteland, Mrs Dalloway**
African American Modernisms *1930s onwards* **Harlem Renaissance**

### The Modernist Novel

Reality and its truth had gone *inward*
Emphasis on consciousness and flow of reflections *Flawed impressionistic narrators* **apparent truths, utterly tricky!**
Content less important than style *importance of language* **move toward poetry**
No identifiable authorial point of view about subject and events, *readers interpretation, readers aren't told how to think* **Often open ended, no closure**
Reader immersed in *unfamiliar world*, **lack of orienting preambles / descriptions** moving through and mapping a world you are in
