# Essay 1 - Introduction
## Mission Statement: Brief Overview of Horror and Supporting Texts

This thesis aims to explore the evolution of the horror genre across mediums, examining it with a focus on intertextuality in order to measure the genre's unique capacity to stimulate and evoke emotional responses in audiences through psychological means. This research displays how horror has maintained a unique relationship with the human psyche, with the capabilities of invoking deep-rooted, primal emotions through manipulation of specific medium conventions. Through the exploration of this, this thesis sets out to discuss how horror as a genre actively shapes societal anxieties, present in both early Gothic works and postmodern, contemporary interpretations. Through textual analysis, this research aims to prove how the medium itself is self-generative, evolving and reforming around the expectations of the collective consciousness generated by the medium itself.

In defining horror, we make associations between the genre and it's relation to human emotion. Stephen T. Asma draws this conclusion when defining horror in his chapter 'The Art of Human Vulnerability, Angst and Horror' where he locates the origin of the word from the Latin verb which means to "stand on end" and also identifies how horror is defined by both the genre itself, and the human emotion the genre is designed to invoke (Asma 183). The manipulation of conventions to invoke said emotion, is a facet of horror that can be identified in its roots, as the concept has evolved alongside the development of the mediums itself, and the social and cultural contexts of its audiences. 

This can be effectively identified through the continuous subversion of expectations, and shattering of audiences familiarities. This in tandem with the exposure to sublime concepts, are trends which occur to challenge human cognitions inherent want to comprehend the world around us. The genre has the mechanical capabilities of both exposing and exploiting humans vulnerabilities, and through intense, immersive utilisation of both narrative devices and mechanics of traditional mediums, texts are able to force memorable and lasting revelations on audiences which provide substance to the evolutionary growth of the genre.

Prior to literature, horror can be seen strewn across folklore of a variety of cultures. These folkloric interpretations of horror hinge on the existence of the supernatural and the projection of monsters to enforce morals and lessons. David D. Gilmore covers this in his book, 'On Monsters', where he identifies that monsters, across cultures, act as metaphors for human qualities which society desires to externalize and vanquish (Gilmore 1-4). Death is commonly explored through folklore in tandem with this, with different mythos accounting their own interpretations of ghosts and the afterlife. This is revealing to the nature of humans, showing that across cultural boundaries there is a natural urge to comprehend that which we cannot, alongside the qualities of humans that society has come to reject. Exposure to the supernatural instils a sublime terror in people, whereas the exposure of rejected human qualities manifests inner frustration. The exploration of both of these can be seen in early Gothic literature, which became synonymous with divulging in the contradictions strewn across societal norms, alongside the introduction to the supernatural. This was done to invoke terror in audiences, oftentimes using pre-existing folklore in tandem with societal clauses, such as the birth of the vampire as we know it in contemporary literature, stemming from the original folkloric origins in combination with the juxtaposing aristocratic facets of Victorian society. 

Both narrative and psychological analysis of texts and their condition on the human psyche correlate with traditional human responses. This reveals how people enjoy horror as a controlled form of experiencing fears and thrills which we would naturally be opposed to in a realistic setting, or wouldn't experience otherwise. This relates to the concept of catharsis. Originating from Greek drama and philosophy, catharsis invites the notion that the psychological response which comes from fright allows for the release of stress, processing fear vicariously. This thesis aims to explore both modern and traditional gothic horror under this context, identifying specific ruptures and crux's of the genre which have evolved to provide cathartic experiences to the evolving cognition of human society. 

The core texts which this thesis aims to analyse each develop this concept of catharsis, in ways unique to their respective mediums and within the context of culture and society around the time of their release. Mark Z. Danielewski's 'House of Leaves' does so uniquely through the active physical metamorphosis of the book itself, a mechanic which works in tandem with its narrative to depict and invoke sublime terror, and the natural human responses to said terror. Similarly, 'Bloodborne', a horror video game developed by renowned studio and director, FromSoftware and Hidetaki Miyazaki, utilises gameplay mechanics to invoke the core themes of its narrative. This allows players to submerge themselves in a Gothic, Lovecraftian inspired text in a means only accessible through the medium specificity of video games. These contemporary examples of horror literature each utilise the mechanics of their mediums which audiences are accustomed to, and breaks these conventions in ways to invoke terror while also remaining intact and relevant to the narratives told in each of the texts. 

The breaking of conventions showed in these texts, is allowed through the initial development and familiarization of them through traditional Gothic texts. This thesis will be analysing John William Polidori's 'The Vampyre' and Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' to highlight this. These texts do not greatly subvert the mechanical aspects of their mediums but rather subvert audiences expectations and understandings of societal conventions at the time to great effect, producing Gothic horror as a result. This method of juxtaposing audiences familiarities, and exposing dark truths in society, was core to early Gothic literature and as such reveals how catharsis was invoked at the time. Since the popularisation of horror through traditional early Gothic texts, the development of how authors induce catharsis to audiences has greatly adapted in response to an ever shifting audience. This can be identified in the design of both 'House of Leaves' and 'Bloodborne', and this thesis aims to analyse these design choices and identify how these modern bastions of the horror genre show exponential growth in horror as a genre and medium.

The proceeding analysis of these texts, reveal how the horror genre narratively challenges human cognition, in a nature which has developed across mediums over time. These traits which will be identified, reveal the varying nature of the exploration of horror and how traits originating from traditional literature have not altered but rather expanded since their conception. These traits of the genre, reveal much about human cognition and our natural responses to stimuli. Similarly to how Asma relates the emotion of horror to the genre, the traits of the genre are revealing to our emotional responses (Asma 183). Through identifying how these texts then invoke catharsis, this study will explore the limitations and complexities of the human mind, what it means to comprehend the incomprehensible and furthermore how authors are able to carve their narratives to invoke terror in texts. Danielewski does this throughout 'House of Leaves', distorting the fabric of the book itself in a way which both deceives readers and invites them to submerge into the terror the text encapsulates, teasing the unravelling of reality through its entirely unique and metamorphic narrative.
## Analysis of House of Leaves: a narrative analysis of sublime terror

Mark Z. Danielewski's, 'House of Leaves' is a horror text which quickly became renowned for its unconventional, multi-perspective narrative and unique physical design of the book itself. The narrative follows the Navidson family as they move into their new home at Ash Tree Lane, the father Will of which is a photojournalist. After some time living there, the family begin to notice unexplainable changes to the house, its dimensions altering slightly, new doors appearing, and rooms existing in impossible spaces. These changes continue to occur until a dark labyrinth spawns beneath the house, leading Will Navidson, assisted by his family and other affiliated characters, to begin to document the terror of the house.  

The initial terror of the text comes from this failure to comprehend the workings of the house itself. Asma continues in 'On Monsters' to identify an 'undeniable cognitive component to monster fear', elaborating that humans have an understanding of what is 'essential for human life' (Asma 184). He continues to explain how this causes fear when monsters blur this line, exhibiting features of both life and death. In 'House of Leaves' the house is an ambient, seemingly non-sentient anomaly, and while it doesn't form that stark juxtaposition between life and death, it's nature does defy logic, and disturbs humans natural understanding of physics while also 'transgressing the categories of animate and inanimate' as Asma puts it (Asma 184).

Where the complexities of the text begin to show is in the chronology of how it's narrative is told, as "The Navidson Record", the fictional movie made by Will Navidson about the house, is implied to have already been filmed and published within the fictional world of 'House of Leaves'. The reader then learns of the events of the filming at Ash Tree Lane through two additional perspectives. One of which is a blind old man named Zampanò, an enigmatic figure who analyses and creates a manuscript which breaks down the events of "The Navidson Record". Johnny Truant then is another perspective, a younger man who discovers Zampanò's manuscript and finds himself deep in the exploration of the text, fascinated by the horrors it reveals of the spatial anomalies which occur at Ash Tree Lane. 

The text itself uses physical properties of the medium to distinguish between these perspectives, utilising a continually changing font and typeface as the narrative shifts between characters. Johnny's story is told in a blog-post style, with a typewriter font, Zampanò's manuscript is depicted as a complex mess of notes riddled with footnotes while Navidson's perspective is captured through an atypical third-person narration, as if describing the events of the recorded film itself. This allows for a constantly shifting narrative which embraces ambiguity and curiosity, feeding the readers insights into the incomprehensible phenomenon which occurred at Ash Tree Lane, but through the perspectives of several characters who too, are attempting to comprehend it through their own respective mediums. 

Zampanò's academic accounting of events, Johnny's personal exploration and the third-person documentation of Navidson's experience allows for a multi-layered account of the narrative which reflects the labyrinthic nature of the house itself. Each character's own interpretation of events creates layers of depth in understanding said sublime phenomenon, which the reader never gets to experience first-hand without a buffer. This bewilders the reader, while in tandem encouraging them to comprehend the house alongside the multiple characters and perspectives which are offered up. This reinforces the incomprehensible nature of the house, which is then later reinforced by the metamorphosis of the book itself. 

German philosopher Martin Heidegger discusses the philosophy and existentialism that surrounds the concept of Being, in his book, 'Being and Time', and many of his revelations are relevant to the intentions behind 'House of Leaves' narrative. He argues on the basis of Greek philosophy that Being is 'the most universal and emptiest of concepts', yet despite being a concept so universal, harbours some of the darkest connotations (Heidegger 22-23). Being is a contradictory notion, as to understand anything roughly defined as an entity is to define Being also, and to do this, one must define the notion of Being within understandable logic and structure (Heidegger 25-26). Humans have done so throughout history, defining and applying our own logic to the world around us in order to answer the question of being. When something defies structure and logic as humans define it, that question of being becomes unearthed, and we see this actively occur throughout 'House of Leaves'.

We see terror unfold throughout the narrative as the Navidson's are left vulnerable and exposed to their own home, a space which should be defined by their presence, and what structure they apply to it. Yet the house moves and contorts by itself in a manner no house should, defying logic and disturbing the family deeply as they become mentally trapped by the torment the house implies. This experience is entirely mimicked by the text itself, which too defies the structure and logic predefined by readers, forcing readers into a mirrored experience of the Navidson's exploration of the house. This is enabled through the multi-layered perspectives of the text, which act as the readers sole interpretation of events. Similar to how the Navidson's are left exposed and vulnerable as the house begins to shift, readers too experience this as the trusted perspectives for which they interpret the story begin to shift too. Anywhere the word "house" is used, the font changes slightly, shifting off the line or altering type face. Strange messages lie within Zampanò's footnotes which progressively get more convoluted as the text drags on. These nuanced shifts within the text exponentially grow into a complete metamorphosis as Navidson and his assistants begin their expeditions into the dark labyrinth, where the pages begin to drastically alter in tandem with the changes to the house.  

H.P. Lovecraft defines the fear of the unknown as the 'oldest and strongest kind of fear' in his essay on 'Supernatural Horror in Literature' (Lovecraft 1). He goes on to write on how humans interpretations of the world were made in reference to the 'awe and fear' which surrounded them as they came to understand the environments they were born into, leading the 'unknown' and 'unpredictable' to being in separate spheres 'wherein we have no part' (Lovecraft 1). Analysing this analogy in comparison to Heidegger's definition of Being, reveals humans intrinsic need to define things by logic, and the primal fear which follows when we are unable. 'House of Leaves' hinges on this primal fear, with the continuous force which drives the narrative across perspectives being the constant attempts to both understand and define the house on Ash Tree Lane. This becomes increasingly prominent as the narrative see's the characters delve into the sprawling depths beneath the house on Ash Tree Lane, where the text invokes sublime terror the most.

The labyrinth beneath the house is continually described as an empty abyss of nothing, sometimes enormous in scale, other times claustrophobic, but always completely dark, logically incomprehensible, and occasionally echoed with the unrecognizable bellows of something within its walls. In S.T. Joshi's, 'A Dreamer and a Visionary', he reflects on what Lovecraft deems to be one of his earliest works, a story where 'a boy...overheard some horrible conclave of subterranean beings in a cave' (Joshi 25-39). Similar to this prose, the depths in 'House of Leaves' utilises fears of the unknown, and the visceral associations humans have with subterranean unknowns, and unrecognizable auditory phenomena. It is during these expeditions, that the text in 'House of Leaves' begins to mirror the house. During moments of empty expanse, the pages become more sparse, becoming filled with negative space. Words physically stretch across the page as the hallways elongate. Text flips upside down, margins become narrow, and the reading experience becomes a jarring reflection of the journey that Navidson and his crew take beneath the house. The more isolated the characters find themselves, the less words begin to fill the pages until the readers finds themselves reading a single word per page. This process of metamorphosis of the medium captures the sublime horror of the house perfectly as the readers exploration of the text becomes a complete reflection of the exploration of the house itself. Similar to how the house breaks conventions associated with that of a typical house, the text does this in the same way, breaking the conventions of books and assumptions of the reading experience in a way that both disorientates and terrifies the reader.
## Overview of catharsis: looking at the functions of the medium

This execution by Danielewski demonstrates a profound example of catharsis. The readers are submerged into the text with a false sense of security, as is the Navidson's with their home, Zampanò with "The Navidson Record", and Johnny with Zampanò's manuscript. Each with the intention of comprehending the initial enigmatic terror of the house. Through the metamorphosis and physical distortion of the text, readers experience the deep-rooted vulnerabilities shared with the characters within the narrative, and the unconventional layout of the text submits readers to the psychological disorientation akin to the Navidson's experience with the house and it's labyrinth. This distortion of text enables readers to experience the process undergone by the Navidson's, which would otherwise be impossible to replicate given the supernatural nature of the event. In this way, the narrative and mechanics of the medium are intimately connected and through the experience of catharsis, allows the terror to be replicated through the text itself.

Where 'House of Leaves' excels beyond normal executions of catharsis is in how it develops upon this by constructing its narrative around the punishment of morbid curiosity. Similarly to how the text breaks convention of its physical medium, the narrative also develops contradictory to the experience that the text invokes. Thus far, the text has mirrored the exploration of the house and other texts within the world of the narrative with the experience the reader is having. In doing this, the text encourages the readers to pursue it, offering the experience of catharsis as an active reward for partaking in the consummation of the text. In 'On Monsters', Asma recalls a research experiment of Darwin's which involved exposing monkeys to snakes. The research showed that while monkeys would react negatively and avoid as much as a stuffed snake, that when a live snake was placed within a bag, they took turns inspected the bag and fleeing (Asma 3). Despite seeing other monkeys' interaction with the snake in the bag, driven by curiosity, they each took turns in replicating this experience. A similar phenomenon can be seen encouraged throughout the reading of 'House of Leaves', with readers being exposed to the active consequence of pursuing morbid curiosity, yet being driven to pursue their own morbid curiosity within the text as a result.

Despite this encouragement, the narrative itself continually reinforces themes which contradict this incentive. The character of Johnny Truant is a prime example of this, as he is quite similar to the reader in that he has an outward perspective, looking inward at the happenings of Ash Tree Lane, his morbid curiosity driven by the contents of Zampanò's manuscript. The further Johnny pursues the contents of the manuscript, the more fractured he becomes as he faces implications both mental and physical. His life and relationships become tattered with crisis and he begins to hallucinate and gradually lose his grip on reality. Similarly, Will Navidson's downfall is spelled by his pursuit of the house's truths, and his insistence on documenting the house becomes less so about making the documentary and moreso about comprehending the enigmatic house itself, grounding it within his own logic. In Asma's journal entry, 'Monsters on the Brain' in 'Social Research: An International Quarterly', he discusses the underestimated role which art plays in peoples applications of values (Asma 953-954). He argues that texts play an important role in shaping viewers emotional responses, particularly to what he refers to as "terrifying trials" such as to "be put on the frontlines of some war, or be robbed...harassed and assailed", and other such occurrences which one would never hope to be exposed to (Asma 953-954). He goes on further to say that authors of texts have the ability to "convey moral visions" and therefore allow audiences to "reflect on them, reject or embrace them...and otherwise be enriched beyond entertainment and catharsis" (Asma 954). 'House of Leaves' feigns this truth, with Navidson portrayed as the vision conveying author, and Zampanò, Johnny and the reader therefore enriched by catharsis, yet actively contradicts this truth by punishing the characters who pursue it.

Navidson's end see's him returning to the house despite all warnings in a segment that descends him into near madness at the sheer exposure to the house, which he narrowly escapes. Whereas the other characters ends are either left ambiguous, or mentally shattered. Each of these characters are exposed to and are partially ruined by terror through catharsis by their respective devices throughout the narrative, such as "The Navidson Record's" effect on Zampanò, and his manuscripts effect on Johnny. With each character mirroring the readers experience, the readers device is the text itself through which they are continuously exposed to catharsis. The contradictory nature of the narrative both warns the reader of the pursuit of morbid curiosity, while simultaneously encouraging the pursuit of the text through the reward of catharsis. This simulates further disorientation, psychological distress and self-doubt within the reader. This is further reinforced by the first page of the text reading simply, "this is not for you" (Danielewski ix).
