## Mission Statement: Brief Overview of Horror and Supporting Texts

This thesis aims to explore the evolution of the horror genre across mediums, examining with a focus on intertextuality in order to measure the genre's unique capacity to stimulate and evoke emotional responses in audiences through psychological means. This research displays how horror has maintained a unique relationship with the human psyche, with the capabilities of invoking deep-rooted, primal emotions through manipulation of specific medium conventions. Through the exploration of this, this thesis sets out to discuss how horror as a genre actively shapes societal anxieties, present in both early Gothic works and postmodern, contemporary interpretations. Through textual analysis, this research aims to prove how the medium itself is self-generative, evolving and reforming around the expectations of the collective consciousness generated by the medium itself.

In defining horror, we make associations between the genre and it's relation to human emotion. Stephen T. Asma draws this conclusion when defining horror in his chapter 'The Art of Human Vulnerability, Angst and Horror' where he locates the origin of the word from the Latin verb which means to "stand on end" and also identifies how horror is defined by both the genre itself, and the human emotion the genre is designed to invoke (Asma 183). The manipulation of conventions to invoke said emotion, is a facet of horror that can be identified in its roots, as the concept has evolved alongside the development of the mediums itself, and the social and cultural contexts of its audiences. 

This can be effectively identified through the continuous subversion of expectations, and shattering of audiences familiarities. This in tandem with the exposure to sublime concepts, are trends which occur to challenge human cognitions inherent want to comprehend the world around us. The genre has the mechanical capabilities of both exposing and exploiting humans vulnerabilities, and through intense, immersive utilisation of both narrative devices and mechanics of traditional mediums, texts are able to force memorable and lasting revelations on audiences which provide substance to the evolutionary growth of the genre.

Prior to literature, horror can be seen strewn across folklore of a variety of cultures. These folkloric interpretations of horror hinge on the existence of the supernatural and the projection of monsters to enforce morals and lessons. David D. Gilmore covers this in his book, 'On Monsters', where he identifies that monsters, across cultures, act as metaphors for human qualities which society desires to externalize and vanquish (Gilmore 1-4). Death is commonly explored through folklore in tandem with this, with different mythos accounting their own interpretations of ghosts and the afterlife. This is revealing to the nature of humans, showing that across cultural boundaries there is a natural urge to comprehend that which we cannot, alongside the qualities of humans that society has come to reject. Exposure to the supernatural instils a sublime terror in people, whereas the exposure of rejected human qualities manifests inner frustration. The exploration of both of these can be seen in early Gothic literature, which became synonymous with divulging in the contradictions strewn across societal norms, alongside the introduction to the supernatural. This was done to invoke terror in audiences, oftentimes using pre-existing folklore in tandem with societal clauses, such as the birth of the vampire as we know it in contemporary literature, stemming from the original folkloric origins in combination with the juxtaposing aristocratic facets of Victorian society. 

Both narrative and psychological analysis of texts and their condition on the human psyche correlate with traditional human responses. This reveals how people enjoy horror as a controlled form of experiencing fears and thrills which we would naturally be opposed to in a realistic setting, or wouldn't experience otherwise. This relates to the concept of catharsis. Originating from Greek drama and philosophy, catharsis invites the notion that the psychological response which comes from fright allows for the release of stress, processing fear vicariously. This thesis aims to explore both modern and traditional gothic horror under this context, identifying specific ruptures and crux's of the genre which have evolved to provide cathartic experiences to the evolving cognition of human society. 

The core texts which this thesis aims to analyse each develop this concept of catharsis, in ways unique to their respective mediums and within the context of culture and society around the time of their release. Mark Z. Danielewski's 'House of Leaves' does so uniquely through the active physical metamorphosis of the book itself, a mechanic which works in tandem with its narrative to depict and invoke sublime terror, and the natural human responses to said terror. Similarly, 'Bloodborne', a horror video game developed by renowned studio and director, FromSoftware and Hidetaki Miyazaki, utilises gameplay mechanics to invoke the core themes of its narrative. This allows players to submerge themselves in a gothic, Lovecraftian inspired text in a means only accessible through the medium specificity of video games. These contemporary examples of horror literature each utilise the mechanics of their mediums which audiences are accustomed to, and breaks these conventions in ways to invoke terror while also remaining intact and relevant to the narratives told in each of the texts. 

The breaking of conventions showed in these texts, is allowed through the initial development and familiarization of them through traditional Gothic texts. This thesis will be analysing John William Polidori's 'The Vampyre' and Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' to highlight this. These texts do not greatly subvert the mechanical aspects of their mediums but rather subvert audiences expectations and understandings of societal conventions at the time to great effect, producing Gothic horror as a result. This method of juxtaposing audiences familiarities, exposing dark truths in society, was core to early Gothic literature and as such reveals how catharsis was invoked at the time. Since the popularisation of horror through traditional early Gothic texts, the development of how authors induce catharsis to audiences has greatly adapted in response to an ever shifting audience. This can be identified in the design of both 'House of Leaves' and 'Bloodborne', and this thesis aims to analyse these design choices and identify how these modern bastions of the horror genre show exponential growth in horror as a genre and medium.

The proceeding analysis of these texts, reveal how the horror genre narratively challenges human cognition, in a nature which has developed across mediums over time. These traits which will be identified, reveal the varying nature of the exploration of horror and how traits originating from traditional literature have not altered but rather expanded since their conception. These traits of the genre, reveal much about human cognition and our natural responses to stimuli. Similarly to how Asma relates the emotion of horror to the genre, the traits of the genre are revealing to our emotional responses (Asma 183). Through identifying how these texts then invoke catharsis, this study will explore the limitations and complexities of the human mind, what it means to comprehend the incomprehensible and furthermore how authors are able to carve their narratives to invoke terror in texts. Danielewski does this throughout 'House of Leaves', distorting the fabric of the book itself in way which both deceives readers and invites them to submerge into the terror the text encapsulates, teasing the unravelling of reality through its entirely unique and metamorphic narrative.
