# Instructions 
Students will make a lightning (min 4.5 minute, max 5 minute) presentation on the country house and class/gender/culture topic they propose for their project. Peers will discuss and provide feedback for each other in class. 

The best presentations tell stories, which have a beginning, a middle and an end. Your lightning talk, though short, _**no more than 5 minutes, no less than 4.5 minutes**_, must therefore have a structure to it.
# Structure Guide

## Introduction
### 2 Slides, 1 Minute
Explain your topic, and why you think it’s important. You may include here the key thing that interested you in the topic, as well as an outline of what you will talk about in your presentation. Explain what people need to know to understand your research approach and methods.
## Main Body
### 4 Slides, 3 Minutes
 Explain what people need to know to understand your selected country house and inhabitants.  Tell the main body of your story, and make three key points about your house as a case study for the Irish country house: class, gender, and culture. You have not got long, so narrow it down to what is really essential. Only include things in your lightning talk that will have a real impact on achieving the outcomes that you defined.
## Conclusion
### 1 Slide, 1 Minute
Ask yourself: ‘so what?’ Why is this topic important and worthy of study? Summarise. What would you like people to think differently about the Irish country house (or an aspect thereof) as a result of hearing your talk.  Reflect perhaps on the house and family today, and connect your talk to its demise or legacy, or to broader aspects of Irish history. This should help to define your argument.
