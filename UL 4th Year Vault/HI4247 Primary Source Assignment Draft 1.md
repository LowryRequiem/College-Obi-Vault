The First World War, or the Great War as it is often refereed to as, was a phenomenon which effects were felt across the world despite its action being central to Europe. Evidence of the wars relevance in the West can be found when analysing the collections of primary sources such as artefacts, photos, posters and letters which can reveal different perspectives on the war and provide an outlook as to how the war was perceived by those living in the United States throughout this time. The collection of sources chosen to be analysed will provide an outlook onto American perspectives on the war, and reveal attitudes surrounding the war. These sources range from a war-time music book, a Red Cross poster, a photograph depicting Red Cross rations and finally a letter from a member of the 18th Infantry. By analysing these sources, this essay aims to make observations into the perspectives of Americans during the war, those who were in the field and those who were not.  

The first of these primary sources is a music sheet for a war-time song titled, "If I'm not at the roll call: Kiss mother good-bye for me." The music is composed and written by George L Boyden and published by Leo Feist Inc. The promotional artwork on the front of the sheet music shows a group of soldiers in the trenches, collectively in thought imaging two figures, a man and woman, talking. The inside then contains the sheet music notation and lyrics to the piece. On back of the cover then contains an advertisement for an eighty page patriotic song book and a reference to an advertisement in The Saturday Evening Post. The advertisement appears to attempt to persuade readers purchase of the book with the incentive of experiencing the songs of the soldiers, also referred to as "their songs" in the comfort of the American home. It is also incentivised to purchase a copy for those who are dispatched with the slogan "send a copy to your boy over here or over there" being used. The print appears to be a war edition, with a notice from Leo Feist Inc. saying it is a smaller edition than usual to save paper during war times, with Save, save, save being named as the watchword of the day. While the George L Boyden sheet music is a 1918 publication, a date can be seen inscribed onto the top left corner of the music advertisement, which dates that to 27/13/2.  This primary source provides context into how the war was captured in pop culture and media of its time in America. Soldiers war songs being commercially composed and sold to the public with marketing incentives centralized around the war and pandering to those who had loved ones in the field. In addition to providing this perspective, this source also provides evidence into the song itself, significantly the lyrics as war music's origins often manifest through the reproduction or retelling of accounts. This source simultaneously provides insight into the relationship both those at home and those on the field had within media at the time.
