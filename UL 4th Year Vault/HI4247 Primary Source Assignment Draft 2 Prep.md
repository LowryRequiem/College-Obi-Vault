1. **Historical Context**: Begin by providing more historical context about the United States' involvement in World War I. Discuss the factors that led to U.S. entry into the war, the public sentiment at the time, and the broader global context of the conflict. This will help set the stage for the sources you're analyzing.
    
2. **Thematic Organization**: Consider organizing your essay around specific themes or aspects of the American experience during World War I. For example, you can dedicate sections to "War Propaganda and Media," "The Role of the Red Cross," "Soldier Perspectives," and "Homefront Experiences." This thematic approach can help you structure your essay and delve deeper into each aspect.
    
3. **Source Analysis**: While you've described the sources well, make sure to analyze them in greater detail. For each source, discuss not only what it contains but also what it reveals about the attitudes, perceptions, and emotions of Americans during the war. Analyze the visual elements of posters and photographs, dissect the lyrics of the music sheet, and decode the language used in the letter.
    
4. **Compare and Contrast Sources**: After analyzing each source individually, consider comparing and contrasting them. How do the perspectives in the music sheet differ from those in the Red Cross poster or the letter from a soldier? Are there common themes or messages that run through these sources?
    
5. **Integration of Secondary Sources**: To reach your word count, you can integrate relevant secondary sources to support your arguments. Look for academic articles, books, or essays that discuss the role of propaganda, the Red Cross, soldier experiences, or the American homefront during WWI. Use these secondary sources to provide context and strengthen your analysis.
    
6. **Cultural and Societal Impact**: Discuss how the content of these primary sources reflects broader cultural and societal norms and values in the United States during that period. Consider the role of music, art, and literature in shaping public opinion and expressing the sentiment of the time.
    
7. **Historiographical Debate**: If applicable, you can touch on historiographical debates related to World War I. Are there differing interpretations of the war's impact on American society? How have historians analyzed primary sources to understand this period differently over time?
    
8. **Conclusion**: Summarize your findings and provide insights into what these sources collectively reveal about American perspectives during World War I. Discuss the significance of understanding these perspectives in the broader context of the war's history.
    

By incorporating these elements and expanding your analysis of the sources, you should be able to reach your word count while also providing a more comprehensive exploration of the topic. Don't forget to cite any secondary sources you use to support your arguments.
