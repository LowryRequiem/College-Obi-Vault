# Class Notes

## Intro

**Next week starts at library**

Understanding of *visual and material cultures*
These monuments have evolved over time *become microcosms of layers of history* **different owners different periods**

## Palladian style

Manor houses *clever style, easily adapted to budgets* **could be built with local materials and still look good**
Markers of dominance *on the landscape*
Many properties have servant accommodation beneath ground *or that they can't come in the front door* **tunnel entrances**

## What to Read

Notable features *typical or not* **layers of time**
Inside and outside; *rooms layout organisation flow sections vistas*
Trees used to give *glimpses and a build up to a house*
**Key period details** *Main Elevation (front entrance fa√ßade) windows doorways ceilings stairways chimney pieces gardens*
Dominance and longevity *manifested*
Symbolism / mythology *houses heraldry (family crest or coat of arms)* **gods depicted having a good time, angels etc.**
Political or religious affiliations *national history, Christian symbols*

### Read the outside first

Whats the *first impressions* **not randomly, its considered, shape and silhouette**
1750-60s early Gothic revival *castellated, romantic style* **secret passages, crenelations**

later 18th and early 19th century *more about how the property fits into the landscape* **as if a painting**
Suited older houses which had been extended

From the 1820s *those with money began to exercise their imaginations*
Houses designed to *look back romantically on the past
Styles began to evolve *gothic, Elizabethan, Jacobean and classical*

#### Arts and Crafts movement

The later into 19th and 20th we get *the less formidable and symmetrical the houses get in favour of* **whimsical**
Making it look more like a cottage
International modernism *flat roofs*
Variations on the *compact Georgian-villa style*

### Entrance and doorways

Second impression past the front silhouette of the house

### Windows

Paramount to the visual effect of the front elevation
*Showcasing inside and outside*
Vital function *air and light*
Can reveal *clues about the original dates* and **subsequent alterations**

Sash windows *key design element of 18th century*

### Chimney piece

Gave principle focus to *any room* as well as **functional**
Chimney piece = *the entire arrangement of the fireplace, mantelpiece, decorative surroundings*
People gather at a fire *its a social space* **represents heat and comfort**
Because its the focal point of a room *warrants decoration* **i.e. coat of arms, certain type of stone etc.**

### Walls

Early 1700s *panelling* **wood panels covering walls** painted to look more expensive
By mid 1700s *plaster became preferred surface for walls* **regarded in more classical spirit, reflected more light, fire precaution**
From 1770, *wallpapers over plaster*

### Main reception rooms

Move from stately formality of the early modern era *procession and access to more decorative and more comfortable spaces depending on* **status and relationship with owner**

Later then *equally decorative reception rooms with different functions but* **equal access**

Until mid/late 1900s *no service or utility areas visible near reception rooms*
