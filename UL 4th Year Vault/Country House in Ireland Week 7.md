## Twilight of Ascendancy

Twilight *period or state of obscurity, ambiguity, or gradual decline* **term used to describe the slow, post-Famine decline of landowning families of Ireland known as the Ascendancy**

### Mid-1800s Dilemma

Great hunger/great famine *Irish landowners not taking responsibility of those on the land* **if aid is lended, will the Irish become dependant**
Closure of soup kitchens, *laid burden upon the landlords* **poor tax added to cover cost of British Treasury**
Landlords quickly losing money *starving tenants unable to pay rent* **new poor tax to pay for each tenant**

Some landlords felt the burden of responsibility *became bankrupt themselves* **refusing to evict poor suffering people**
Others evicted tenants *when they felt their resources depleted and had no other choice*
Others were opportunistic *not wanting to ruin their lavish lifestyle with the burden of the poor* **cruelly evicted tenants and demolished their homes to make sure they did not try re occupy land**

#### Mass Tenant Evictions

Landlords cleared their estate holdings by *legal process, compelling surrenders, assisting tenant mobility or emigration for trifling sums* **more devious and/or aggressive means**

### Encumbered Estates Act 1849

Even before the Famine *many landlords had large debts*
These debts grew larger during Famine *due to unpaid rents, higher Poor Law tax, heavy spending on relief schemes to help victims of the Famine*
In *July 1849* **Government passed the EEA which established a commission with great powers to sell landlords' property in order to clear their debts**
