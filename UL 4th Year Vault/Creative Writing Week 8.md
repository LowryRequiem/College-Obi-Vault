#### Class Activity

10 lines, childhood memory

A grey-scale maelstrom which hung still in time
A hospital ward frozen, desolate of pride
Swallowed within, I lay, in pause
the world still moved by day, excluding me
No pain, no cause.
As thoughts lingered nowhere and consciousness diminished
Brought clause of a laptop, no internet, diluted.
But one film which layed wait in its drive
To be repeated on end, its life entwined 
As western hues consumed the bleak, the tequila sun shone high
Play moved time once again, until close and repeat
For film fights that which is frozen time, 
And restores its worlds, often desolate of pride



# Reading Report

Death of an Irish woman by Michael Hartnett was a concise but enjoyable read. Its structure let it feel still yet moving which perfectly captured the nostalgic yet desolate tone of the poem. It's consistent use of imagery and metaphor allow it to clearly capture its subject while also delivering on its tone.

Similarly, Seamus Heaney's poem, Digging, is rich with imagery and uses this to creative an immersive nostalgic experience. There is a great sense of admiration throughout the poem which is reinforced by the poetic devices which build the poem up with rhythm and pacing. This leads to the contrast between the poet, his father and grandfather, yet is brought together in resonance using the title and repeated phrase digging as a symbol which brings the entire poem and its elements together.

Carol Ann Duffy's Mrs. Darwin is a short but witty poem that manages to use its structural simplicity to elevate the irony of the piece. With very little context, the poem manages to capture its subject matter and delivers upon that in only a few brief lines.
