I would have studied Howl by Allen Ginsberg on my Erasmus in the Netherlands and it has always stuck with me since. I find within this passage there is so much passion and expression woven into the complex analogies and motifs throughout. It's commentary on the beat generation and how American society has worn down the minds of creatives I find particularly fascinating and the way this is expressed through the motifs within Howl is brilliant.

The use of imagery and personification within T.S. Eliot's Morning at the Window helps reinforce its themes by bringing attention to the mundane everyday occurrences of the city. By highlighting these through these poetic techniques, Elliot brings more attention to these occurrences than one would ever observe in the every day and thus brings this theme into the limelight of the text.

Similarly, William Carlos Williams' Red Wheelbarrow explores the simple and mundane on a complex level using poetic techniques. The poem itself is almost comedically simple, yet it hides so much nuance within its structure and imagery that it almost taunts the idea of deeper meaning to such a simple thing and as a poem challenges how we consume and understand a text.
