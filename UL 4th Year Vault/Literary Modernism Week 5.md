### Introduction

Dispensing with plot, **What are the significant events in life?** 

Internal experience of life *rather than external* **describable events**

Omniscient narrator *moving into Clarissa's perspective*
Novel is set in the present but *floats between past tense* **tunnelling process**
	*Seeking to dig out beautiful caves behind my characters.....The caves shall connect and each comes to daylight at the present moment*

### London as city of Modernity

London as a *character* **clash of people and possibilities**
Moments of exploration, *Peter, Elizabeth* **city as a source of life and stories**

## Narrative Technique

### Character

Essay, *Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown*
Woolf says *summing up character through their external factors, income, possessions etc.* **is missing the point, characters slip through their hands**
Character not unified *emphasis on perception, how character sees the world*
**Tolerate the spasmodic, the obscure, the fragmentary, the failure**

### Characters in Mrs Dalloway

Characters seen from *the inside out* **characters fragmentary, hard to sum up**
We see their *impulses, moods, thoughts and memories*

### Narrative Structure

Introduction of *numerous characters in the novel* **meet characters through Clarissa, wider-cross section of London society**
Refusal of *narrative conventions* **of cause and effect**
Life is *random* **full of loose ends, lives brushing against each other**

#### Use of unifying motifs
The *car and the aeroplane*
**Big Ben, different characters hearing Big Ben at different points**
Repeated images and phrases *Fear no more the heat o' the sun*

## Time

Psychological time *subjective and elastic, memory* **memories of Bourton, clear and meaningful**
Linear time *forward progress, history, dates, clocks* **time passes whether we like it or not** Clarissa's father dead, Big Ben
Monumental Time *How do external decisions around time shape the experience of living in time*

# Tutorial Notes, Imagist Poetry

## What are the principals of imagism in poetry?

The *image* is the supreme mode of communication for the poet

Musicality and its *primary impact*

No *superfluous words* only what's *required*

### An Image

An *image* can present an **intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time**

It is *better to present one image in a lifetime* **than to produce voluminous works**
