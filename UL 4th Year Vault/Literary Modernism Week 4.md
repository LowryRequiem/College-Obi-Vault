# Class Notes

## Intro

### Ezra Pound and Imagism

Writer and *editor* **for people like TS Elliot**
Born in Idaho *spends most of his life in Europe* **cross pollination**
### Pound in Pisa

Pound *supported Mussolini and made anti-American radio broadcasts during WW2* **arrested as a traitor in 1945 and confined originally in Pisa**

## Imagism

Movement in American and English poetry 1912-17 *use of concrete language, figures of speech* **modern subject matter, metrical freedom, avoidance of romantic or mystical themes**

Aiming at *clarity of expression* **through use of precise visual images**

### Ezra pound, A few dont's by an imagist

An *image* is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an *instant of time* **its presentation of such a complex instantaneously gives a sense of sudden liberation**
that sense of freedom from *time limits and space limits* **sense of sudden growth which we experience in the presence of the greatest works of art**

It is better to present one imagine in a lifetime than to produce *voluminous works*

#### Language

Simplicity
Use of *no superfluous words* **no adjectives which do not reveal something**
Don't use an expression which dulls an image *it mixes abstraction with concrete* **give clear image of land, go in fear of abstractions**

#### Music

Should make their work sound beautiful *but also reflects the meaning of the poem* **let the beginning of the next time catch the rise of the rhythm wave**
Behave as a musician *when dealing with the phase of your art which has exact parallels in music* **the same laws govern**

## In the Station of the Metro 1913

*The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
Petals on a wet, black bough*

In a poem like this pound explains *one is trying to record the precise instant when a thing outward and objective transforms itself or darts into a thing inward and subjective*  **something experiences externally is echoing the internal feeling of the poet in the moment** 

Poem is an observation of the faces seen in a Paris subway station

The word *apparition* has a double meaning, binds two aspects together; *apparition meaning appearances in the sense that something can appear and be observed* **apparition meaning something which seems real bit perhaps is not real; something ghostly which cannot be clearly observed** He sees faces turned variously toward light and darkness like flower petals

### Haiku

The juxtaposition of two images of ideas that are *unexpectedly related*
**17 Syllables, in three phases of 5, 7 and 5**
A *kigo* (seasonal reference) drawn from nature in second half

## T.E. Hulme

English critic and poet *important imagist poet*
Served in *France and Belgium 1914* **wounded in 1916, back at the front in 1917, killed by a shell in West Flanders**

### Romanticism vs Classicism

Put shortly, these are two views *one that man is intrinsically good, spoilt by circumstance* **and the other that he is intrinsically limited but disciplined by order and tradition to something fairly decent**

To one party, mans nature is a well *to the other, a bucket*

The view which regards man as a well *is romantic* the one which regards as a very finite and fixed creature *is classical*

#### Classical verse

Even the most imaginative flights there is always *a holding back, a reservation, he remembers that he is mixed up in the earth, an anchored man* **he may jump, but he always returns back, never flies away**

### The Light of Ordinary Day

#### Beauty

Romanticism unable to admit the existence of *beauty without the infinite being in some way or another dragged in* 
Classicism it is essentially to prove that beauty *may be in the small dry things*

#### Major shift in Poetry

Authenticity sought after *paring down of language, less words the better* **poetry as craftsmanship, not flight of inspiration** well wrought image communicates everything

### Moon

Both poems by Hulme offers images of the moon
In *romantic poetry* **moon is typically imaged as a focus for transcendent thought, love and romance, reflection of mans imagination**
In *classical poetry* an image of the moon is presented as a **ruddy farmer of lost childs balloon, finite classical images**

## Hulme War Poetry

Slim output of poetry in his life *about 20 pages prior to the war*
Composed and *recites this war poem* **but refused to write it down**
Ezra Pound published it *in an anthology of poetry titled Catholic Anthology*

### Trenches St Eloi

*My mind is a corridor. The minds about me are corridors*

Images used *captures both the external environment in the trenches* **while also capturing the psyche of the poet in that moment**
Betrays the notion of comradery often encouraged in war literature
Concreate images *without embellishment*

### TS Eliot and TE Hulme

Eliot an admirer of Hulmes poetry *and theories about poetry* **both poets resist the optimism of romanticism in poetry and attend instead to the creation of ** *new and surprising images that accurately convey reality*

## William Carlos Williams

Born 1883, Jersey, American *Mother Puerto Rico, English father raised in the Dominican Republic*
Worked as a doctor
*Influenced by Ezra Pound* **Says Elliot returned us to the classroom, rooted in the locality**

### Spring and All

Imagist response to *the Wasteland* **Argues for American literature, plain American and criticizes the Anglo-American work of Eliot**
Seeks to remove the *constant barrier that makes* **modern literature incomprehensible**

### The Red Wheel Barrow

## Hilda Doolittle

Born Pennsylvania, *travels to Europe* **seeks therapy from and studies with Freud**

### Oread

A nymph of the forest *demands a sea of action, rises in crescendo from whirl to splash to hurl* **sexual and suicidal elements to it, the overwhelming of the self, to be emerged** 
Connects reader to the sea in an *intense, intimate matter*
A picture making mode of thought *rather than an analytical mode* **poem does not rely on simile**

### Dreams and Displacement

The waves made of pine tree and trees made of water *have a quality analogous to the dream* **the rational conscious mind would not see pine tree waves, splashing pines, or pools of fire** such visions belongs to the *Kingdom of the Illogical*

Freuds syntax of the dream work includes *important tech known as displacement* **intense feelings are projected onto a relatively unimportant person or set of events**
The Oreads identity and sexual emotions *are displaced onto a natural event* **the meeting of the land and sea at the shoreline**

## W.B. Yeats

Yeats and Pound *great friends* **Wintered together in a cottage in Sussex**

### Yeats moves towards Imagism

Influenced by *the modern movement*
During these winters at the cottage that *Pound converted Yeats* **Yeats was still dragging some of the reeds of the nineties in his hair**

### In Fear of Abstractions

Pound would frequently urge Yeats to *make changes in words or lines to get further away from the nineties* **the older poet asked him to go through his verse and point out abstractions**
Yeats surprised at the amount marked *made a renewed effort to purge his verse of weakness and abstractions*
New verse is more spare, *images are exactly delineated by the words* **every shadow is removed**

## Summary; Imagism

Direct treatment of *the thing* **whether subjective or objective**
To use absolutely *no word that does not* **contribute to the presentation**
To compose poetry with attention to the musicality of *words and rhythm*
to make anew, *new kind of poetry that* **reflects modern life**
