Horse hooves clacketed down Main Street, kicking up mud and rubble as I watched from an adjacent alley. I hauled my sack of steel scrap close to me as I hugged the wall. Carefully raising my camcorder to my face, and let it trace along the street focusing on the riding militia men. Would make for some good B-Roll footage. I clamped the screen shut and tucked it away before continuing on. Had to be mindful of the militia, they'd usually let me pass but with the scrap on me you'd never know. I maneuverer further along Main Street and passed through the eerily quiet square. You wouldn't notice it at first, but positioned up in windows atop the old town apartments and council houses were sentries. There were more men on lookout than usual too, their watching eyes passing along the streets like security cameras, their rifles at the ready. I stuck to the alleys I knew, carefully passing along to the far side of town, the other side of the Whitehorse River. Once I knew it was safer, I took the camera out again.

I dragged the camera along the derelict buildings of Mountrath, there boarded up fronts complimenting their lifeless stature. I figured I should provide some commentary, to fill the looming silence that had infected this side of town. It's been a year and twenty seven days since the power went out, though admittedly it's been harder to keep track the further we get from outage day. Dad likes to keep count, says it reminds him that time is, in fact still moving, despite all the clocks hanging still. It wasn't just the power though, all electronic devices just ceased to function. Houses were left like doll houses, full of useless utilities providing nothing but shelter and security, cars were left paused in drives and car parks and light even became a limited resource, hence my venture to town today. Dad had sent me in for candles and turf off Mary Moore. The last time I came trading though she wouldn't part ways with her turf, said they'd be needing as much as they could hold on to for winter. I told him that too, all he said was "she'll have candles," and left it at that. When the raiding's had started, the Moore's were lucky in that they choose to bunker down in the church along with a load of other families. Now it was both a stronghold and centre for trade for the town. They were one of the three families running the place now, and the only family that me and Dad were on decent terms with. Turning the camera on its side, I captured a vertical shot of the church, and the large wooden perimeter that started at the gates and pulled back to its main entrance. I lay the camera down there, leaving it run while I approached the main gate. It watched on as I wrapped the gate with a knock which let them know I was here to trade. A few words, latch opens and bag exchanges later and I was up fifty candles.

The walk home was always arduous. Raiders sweeped the roads in hopes of clashing with traders vans or moving settlements, or in this case a kid with fifty candles. I stuck to the fields I knew were safe enough, and kept an eye on the roads panning the camera along. Crows stirred from haunting branches above, their caws resonating into the emptiness of once cow ridden fields. The power lines hung in mockery from above. Since the power went out, main cities have been cesspools of looters. Not that they have much of importance going on now anyways, rural towns became mans bastion of survival with farmers and laborers winning the career jackpot in this powerless dystopia. Dad had gone through phases of carpentry and engineering work, now he was a full time metal smith. Up in the Slieve Blooms, our once humble two story was now an iron fortress of spiked bars and metal perimeters. A bit overkill for it being just the two of us I've always reckoned, but he's just been that way since Mom died. We spent the first few months since outage day desperately trying to find or trade for her medicine but sure it was no use. We lost Elle once winter came then, coldest one in years it felt. That's what had everyone on edge now, summer had come to a close and hopes were running out. Still no contact from the outside of Ireland, and no-one who's left the country has come back. Now we had another winter to face. I kept the camera held high as I pushed through dense hedges and leaped over bogs and ditches. Some of them still had barbed wire from when the Fitz's were set up here in the spring, rust, blood and muck were each embedded into the barbs. The smell was dire, the camera couldn't quite capture that.
