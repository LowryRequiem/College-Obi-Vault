# The Significance of the Intended in "Heart of Darkness"

In the closing pages of Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," the figure of the Intended takes centre stage in a poignant and enigmatic scene. This scene serves as a crucial point of reflection and a stark contrast to the darkness and brutality that dominate the novel. Conrad's choice to end the novel with this particular interaction between the Intended and Marlow holds significant thematic and symbolic importance.

## Setting and Imagery

The setting is crucial to understanding the scene's significance. As the dusk falls and envelops the room, it mirrors the overall thematic darkness that has been a prevailing force throughout the novel. However, within this encroaching darkness, the Intended's home is depicted as a haven of purity and naivety. The description of her "ivory, pale" features and her ethereal presence creates a sharp contrast to the savagery Marlow has encountered in the heart of Africa.

The Intended's home, filled with ivory and adorned with white flowers, represents the European colonialist's illusion of purity and righteousness, a stark juxtaposition to the brutal exploitation and moral degradation that occur in the Congo. The use of ivory as a motif in the scene underscores the hypocrisy of European imperialism, where the very symbol of purity is derived from the exploitation and suffering of the African people.

## Dialogue

The dialogue in this scene is equally significant. Marlow, burdened by the knowledge of Kurtz's moral descent and the horrors he witnessed in the Congo, is faced with a dilemma. Should he reveal the truth to the Intended, shattering her idealized image of Kurtz, or should he preserve her illusions?

Marlow's choice to lie to the Intended and spare her the truth reveals the novel's central theme of the moral ambiguity of imperialism. Marlow, like other European colonizers, chooses to conceal the darkness that lies at the heart of imperialism, allowing the Intended to continue living in her delusion of European righteousness. This decision reinforces the idea that the truth is often too brutal to be confronted, and it highlights the moral compromises that individuals make in the name of empire.

## The Symbolic Conclusion

Conrad's choice to end the novel with this scene is significant in several ways. First, it serves as a powerful commentary on the hypocrisy and moral blindness of European colonialism. The Intended, embodying the idealized image of European womanhood, remains blissfully ignorant of the atrocities committed in the name of civilization. This contrast between the darkness of the Congo and the purity of the Intended's world highlights the stark divide between reality and illusion in the colonialist project.

Second, the scene emphasizes the destructive consequences of the pursuit of ivory and wealth. The white flowers and ivory, symbolic of purity and wealth, are ironically tainted by the suffering and exploitation that underpin their acquisition. Conrad uses this imagery to condemn the ruthless pursuit of material gain at the expense of human lives.

In conclusion, the figure of the Intended and her interaction with Marlow in the closing pages of "Heart of Darkness" serves as a powerful commentary on the moral complexities and hypocrisies of European imperialism. Conrad's choice to end the novel with this scene underscores the stark contrast between the darkness of the Congo and the illusion of purity in the European world, highlighting the destructive consequences of colonialism and the moral compromises it demands.

First lines, dusk, cold monumental whiteness, curves, luminous, pale *all stark contrast to how Africa is described*

The room grown darker, *enforcing this idea that darkness does not originate from these European homes but is instead brought to them, colonialist illusion*

Fair hair, pure visage *contrast to the mistress*

He was a remarkable man, you admired him *forced affirmations of Kurtz reinforces the idea of forced ignorance to the atrocities of imperialism*

With each word spoke, the room grew darker *realism setting in, illusion fading*

voice full of mystery, desolation and sorrow *reality speaks for itself*

Stood up....fair hair seemed to catch light...glimmers of gold...…noble heart, generous mind, greatness, nothing remains but a memory, You and I *enforcing that the effect of colonialism is in the hands of those who spread its word and live the lie*

I cannot I cannot believe not yet that i shall never see him again, that nobody shall see him again *this desperation may also represent the desire not to have his memory be him at his worst, force the lie that he was noble for the sake of his legacy*

Don't you hear them? The dusk was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind. *Kurtz final state, is the first whisper in a rising wind of exposing the horrors of colonialism, the whispers speak the truth*

the cry of inconceivable triumph and unspeakable pain *the duality of colonialism itself*

Rendered Kurtz the justice he was due? I could not tell her, it would have been too dark altogether
