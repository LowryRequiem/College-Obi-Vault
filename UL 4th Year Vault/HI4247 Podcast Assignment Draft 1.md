# Introduction, 1-1.5 minutes

Hello, my names Aaron and today in this podcast I'm going to be looking at propaganda in Nazi Germany and how it developed through the war period, and how big a role Joseph Goebbels and his wife played in this development. 

Propaganda as we are familiar with it in the modern world, is a method of biased or misleading communication used for some ulterior motive, oftentimes politically charged. In this most recent century, propaganda is most often utilised through the medium of the internet, television and media. 

While the origins of propaganda can be appointed to several notable anecdotes in history; whether that be written speeches in ancient Greece, monuments in Egypt, the use of coins in the Roman empire or religious propaganda used throughout history. These earlier examples of propaganda showcase the beginnings of a methodology which would grow as society becomes increasingly networked, and it isn't until the outbreak of World War 1 and later World War 2 that we see the systematic implantation of propaganda, an evolution that would create campaigns designed to reprogrammed entire nations under new ideologies. 

No example is as prevalent as the use of propaganda in Nazi Germany, and while much of this can be accounted to the vision and proceedings of Adolf Hitler, it is through the figures of Joseph and Magda Goebbels that we see the strategies surrounding Hitler's framework enacted. 

# What Led to Joseph and Magda being in their position of power?

Looking into Goebbels youth, we can see a series of events play out which may allude to how he became a figure capable of enacting out such a framework.

Born into a catholic family in October of 1897, Josephs early childhood is painted with financial troubles and health issues. He had many health complications with inflammation in his lungs as well as a bone infection in his foot which caused his leg to be deformed, giving him a limp.

He would later receive hardship from this, echoing problems with insecurity and more importantly preventing him from serving in the First World War. While unable to serve, Goebbels would still feel the effects of the war, seeing the defeat and economic decline of Germany while also being exposed to the many political ideologies circling around universities during the war years, like socialism, nationalism and anti-Semitism.

It is no surprise that, similar to Hitler, Goebbels disgruntled youth would lead him to desire sweeping social acceptance later in life, while also resenting many who both opposed him, or who he could attribute blame for both his own struggles and that of his country.

These aligned ideals would come to fruition later in 1933, where after joining the Nazi party nine years prior in 1924, Goebbels nationalistic beliefs would be recognized by Hitler, who would appoint him to be Minister of Propaganda.

Johanna Maria Magdalena Ritschel, later Magda Goebbels, was born November 1901 and would grow up pursuing a career in acting in the film industry. After divorcing her first husband Gunther Quandt in 1929, her social circles would lead her to meeting Joseph, and they would marry in 1931.

# Propaganda's Role in Nazi Germany

Together, the pair would usher in a new framework of propaganda on a scale not previously seen. The First World War saw many countries employing their own propaganda measures - these were mostly utilised to maintain both morale and support for the war effort, while also tailoring countries beliefs to suit the interests of state at the time. 

The Nazi party however, led by the vision of Hitler and the execution of Goebbels, was a propaganda machine like no other. There was a level of control that was only possible due to the nature of the dictatorship, which saw a complete overhaul of culture and media.

The nation was entirely manipulated through propaganda, allowing the Nazis to cultivate a society which both glorified Hitler and detested the Jewish population. While much of this can be accounted to the level of control that the Nazi party had over state, the techniques employed by Hitler and Goebbels allowed further manipulation and a complete overhaul of belief in Germany society.

This foresaw massive developments in propaganda which were only possible due to the sheer scale of the Nazi movement, and the ruthlessness of the party and its leaders.

# Techniques, Strategies, Evolutions

One of the most significant methods in which propaganda was reinforced, was the complete takeover and centralization of media.

Control was taken over newspapers, radio, film and all sorts of media outlets to ensure the Nazi beliefs were preached through all with oppositions  gotten rid of.

The Nazis held the film industry in direct suspicion, claiming it was ran by Jews. Film was an international market which had a integral relationship with the public, a complete take over was not initially possible but rather cultivating the industry to suit Nazi demands and therefore influencing the initial demand in the first place.

This allowed them to usher in an era of pro Nazi filmography, with Goebbels enforcing strict guidelines for filmmakers - and most films either glorifying hitler or depicting negative connotations of the Jews. Films such as Triumph of Will glorified the Nazi regime and Hitler whilst films like the Eternal Jew and Jud SuB throttled anti-semetic narratives to audiences.

This control of the film industry saw a surge in cinema as a popular form of entertainment, causing a significant increase in audiences seeing these films, and therefore tailoring their beliefs. Where this lacked in subtly it made up for in sheer reach of viewership and influence, with film becoming a core part of both German life during this period but also the Nazi party.

Similarly, the tandem control of censorship and publication can be seen executed with news outlets as well. Papers such as Der Sturmer and Volkischer Beobachter continued the trend of enforcing anti-Semetic beliefs, Nazi messages and the glorification of Hitler. Goebbels had a direct hand in manipulating the news fed through the papers and such could dictate the thought stream of the general populous.

All these efforts made through the manipulation of the media was reinforced by the massively successful rallies ran by Goebbels. These rallies were made real feats of spectacle, evoking passionate nationalism on a great scale which reflected the ideals of Nazi Germany. Combined with the charismatic skills of Hitler as an orator, the rallies allowed the pair to reinforce everything they had been enforcing through the media. the likes of the Nuremberg Rallies had over 700,000 people participated in the rally, which feigned a sense of unity and nationalism on a wide scale. This was only then supported by further media coverage, all together fuelling the propaganda machine of Nazi Germany. 

While Goebbels used Hitler as a medium to project Nazi beliefs and ideals, his wife Magda would go on to become a representation of women within the Nazi sphere. Images of Magda with her children were used across posters and films to invoke the image of the ideal family within Nazi beliefs. NS Frauen Warte or the Womans Observer was a magazine which used Magda as a role model, both of social values and commitmemnt to the Nazi regime. With her previous experiences as an actor in the film industry, she became the perfect vessel to represent women within the Nazi propaganda sphere, and this was reinforced with her public appearances alongside Goebbels, her participation with womens organizations. Magda was often involved in mutliple charity organizations, fundraising for winter relief in Winterhilfswerk and promoting activities for public workers with Kraft durch Freude.
Magda's positive public presence then only further strenghthened the appeal of Joseph, as they were able to depict themselves as a strong representative of the ideal Nazi family. 
Similar to how the rallies reinforced the effects through the media, their public appearances kept up this charade too.

Ultimatley, propaganda saw a huge growth curve throughout the legacy of Nazi Germany. While the growth of propaganda can be allocated across many countries throughout the war effort, the study of its cause and effect in Nazi Germany is especially telling. On account of the strict control the Nazi party had, in tandem with the aligned interests and methods of its leaders, propaganda saw a sweeping effect which massivly shaped public opinion. The Nazi party saw an great increase in support from 2.6% in 1928 to 43.9% and while much of this can be allocated to the demands of economic demands and political frustrations of Germany at the time, polls by Goebbels would later show that many Germans supported Hitler and the regimes policies, and these polls were used to further enhance the parties methods of enforcing propaganda and displays a clear adaptation and evolution of it as a mechanism and tool of war. Through the acute methods of Joseph and Magda Goebbels, Hitlers vision was constantly being deliveried to the population through both direct and indirect means with Joseph having complete control of the flow of information - and with the abilitiy to enforce these results through public conformity with rallies and cultural shifts - like the influx of cinema, the molding of groups within society, and the projection of Adolf Hitlers ideals - it is clear that within the cosm of Nazi Germany, propaganda saw a scarily exponential growth curve which displays the dangerous effects of it when left unmonitored, and its enduring legacy is recognised today as one of the most prevelant uses of propaganda across history. 

While Joseph and Magda Goebbels are not solely responsible for this level of propaganda, and much can be attested to the strenght of the Nazi party itself to allow this, their collaboration with Hitler shows how dangerous a tool propaganda can be when those with aligned ideals and malicious intentions are given the sphere and power to wield it.
