# Introduction

In this thesis, it is my aim to explore the evolution of the horror genre across mediums, in an attempt to measure its unique capacity to stimulate and evoke emotional responses in audiences through psychological means. Through my research, I believe that horror holds a particularly unique relationship with the human psyche, and has the capabilities of invoking deep-rooted, primal emotions and responses through manipulation of specific conventions of mediums. Through the exploration of this, I aim to discuss how horror as a genre actively shapes societal anxieties, present from early Gothic works to postmodern interpretations, and how as a medium its self-generative collective consciousness allows itself to evolve and reform as the expectations of the medium itself does. 

The manipulation of conventions to engage with audiences is a facet of horror that can be identified in its roots, and has since evolved in tandem with the developments of the mediums themselves, and the social and cultural contexts of audiences. This is effectively done through continuous subversion of expectations, and shattering of trusts and familiarities of audiences, and forced exposure to sublime concepts which challenge human cognitions inherent want to understand and comprehend the world around us. The genre has the mechanical capabilities of both exposing and exploiting human vulnerabilities, and through intense, immersive utilisation of both narrative devices and mechanics of traditional mediums, is able to force memorable and lasting revelations on audiences which provide substance to the growth curve of the genre.

Before literature, horror can be seen strewn across folklore of a variety of cultures. These folklore and mythological interpretations of horror often use supernatural and otherworldly entities to enforce morals and lessons. Death is most often explored through this, through interpretations of the afterlife, ghosts, demons etc. This reveals the human urge to comprehend that which we cannot, and this notion acts as a core aspect of horror throughout its evolution. Sublime terror is found when human cognition is forced to tackle something it doesn't comprehend, or something which contradicts what we do comprehend. In folklore we can see the primer with the exploration of death, and the latter is later found as Gothic literature explores contradictions to societal norms as a device to invoke terror in audiences, oftentimes using pre-existing folklore in tandem with this such as with the concept of vampires stemming from creature mythos combined with contradicting facets of aristocratic society.

Psychological studies of horror have definitively proven its effect on the human psyche, and the correlation it has with traditional human responses. These studies oftentimes find that people enjoy horror as it is a controlled way to experience fears and thrills which we would be opposed to in a realistic setting, or wouldn't experience otherwise. This relates to the concept of catharsis, a psychological term whose origins comes from Greek drama and philosophy, which invites the notion that the psychological response that comes with fright allows for release of stress, allowing the ability to process fear vicariously. It is this concept which this thesis aims to explore through the lens of modern horror mediums, with the intentions of identifying specific ruptures and crux's of the genre which has evolved both alongside and as a response to human cognition.

The core texts which I will be analysing each develop this concept of catharsis, in ways unique to their mediums and the social and cultural contexts of the times they were released. Notably, House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski, does this incredibly uniquely through the active physical metamorphosis of the text, a mechanic that works in tandem with its narrative to depict and invoke sublime terror, and the natural human response to said terror. Similarly, Bloodborne, a video game developed by FromSoftware and directed by Hidetaki Miyazaki, utilises mechanical devices of the video game medium to invoke the core themes of its narrative, and allows players to submerge themselves in a gothic, Lovecraftian text in a means that can only be explored within the genre of video games. These modern examples of horror literature each utilise the mechanics of their mediums which audiences are accustomed to, and breaks these conventions in ways which invoke terror in audiences while also remaining intact and relevant to the narratives told in each of them. 

The breaking of these conventions is allowed through the initial development and familiarization of them which stem from Gothic horror texts such as the Vampyre by John Polidori and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. While these texts do not greatly subvert the mechanical aspects of their mediums, they do subvert audiences expectations and understandings of conventions in society at the time to great effect to produce horror. This method of juxtaposing audience familiarities to expose dark truths in society, was a core theme across much early gothic literature, and as such reveals how catharsis was perceived and executed upon at the time. Since the popularisation of horror through early gothic works, the way in which authors have developed texts to continue to invoke catharsis in an ever expanding and adapting audience market is intrinsic to the design behind both House of Leaves and Bloodborne, and this thesis aims to break these design choices down and identify how they are modern bastions of the horror genre, and evidence to its exponential growth as a genre and medium.

It is evident through the analysis of these texts, that the horror genre is a result of narrative challenges to human cognition which has developed over the course of many years and many mediums. Despite the primitive or complex nature of these varying degrees of horror exploration, there are core traits which have never been replaced but rather expanded upon as we have adapted to the literature interpretations of horror. These traits reveal more about human cognition and our natural emotional responses moreso than tropes of any medium, and it is the aim of this thesis to further explore these ruptures and to develop them to allow a greater understand of our comprehension of horror, and what it reveals about the limitations and complexities of the human mind, and what it means to comprehend the incomprehensible, and furthermore how authors are able to create such texts, through narrative tools which allow them the ability to invoke terror in audiences regardless of scope or measure. House of Leaves does this throughout its narrative, and distorts the medium of books in a way which both deceives readers and invites them to submerge into the terror the text encapsulates, teasing the unravelling of a reality through its entirely unique and metamorphic narrative.
