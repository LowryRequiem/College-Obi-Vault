*Gothic*
**Flash Fiction** *page of prose, big fragment* like a prose poem

### Features of short stories

A conclusive end or cliff hanger end

Novels are safer *can get away with more*
Short stories have more liberty to play with form

#### General Guidelines

Should focus on *experience or viewpoint* **other characters should be introduced so far as they contribute to our understanding of the situation**
Plot should centre around *the resolution of a single problem at a particular moment in time in the life of the main character*
Keep the time span short or find *a concise and economic way of indicating what their lives were before the moment* **and the future while staying focused within the short stories framework**
