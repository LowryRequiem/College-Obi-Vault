## Structure

Seeing as the word count is limiting, need to cut down on set pieces while keeping the same general ideas in tact. Important things to cover are, *mother and sisters deaths, living situation with father, threat of societal collapse, the mental disassociation protagonist has with the world*

Protagonist starts off filming in town, talking about what its been like since the power went out while observing whats happening in Mountrath, he then trades a bag of scrap metal for candles, recounting what his father told him.

The walk back displays the protagonist talking about his home situation and his mother while taking an obscure route home to avoid marauders. His adaptability to the situation while still not mentally processing it should display his disassociation.

As he gets home, we get the description of their fortified home as he enters it through his hiddenly accessible entrance. As he enters, he realises people have broken in and that his father is engaged in combat with him. We are starkly pulled to reality with his father murder the men and discovering the protagonists camera has been broken this whole time.
