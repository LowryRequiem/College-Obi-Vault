# Ideas

## Warded
A grey-scale maelstrom which hung still in time
A hospital ward frozen, desolate of pride
Swallowed within, I lay, in pause
the world still moved by day, excluding me
No pain, no cause.
As thoughts lingered nowhere and consciousness diminished
Brought clause of a laptop, no internet, diluted.
But one film which layed wait in its drive
To be repeated on end, its life entwined 
As western hues consumed the bleak, the tequila sun shone high
Play moved time once again, until close and repeat
For film fights that which is frozen time, 
And restores its worlds, often desolate of pride
