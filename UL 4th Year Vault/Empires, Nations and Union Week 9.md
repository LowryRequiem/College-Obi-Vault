## Introduction

- Development of civil rights movements in Europe, inspiration from US
- Events in France, Czechoslovakia and Northern Ireland
- Prevalence of Authoritarianism, influence of Cold War politics, state vs. individual responsibilities

## Origin of Modern Civil Rights

Demand for greater civil rights *not a modern phenomenon* **but after the second world war saw question in the development of modern societies**
Different to human rights in that *they must be provided by the state*
The end of the second world war and the *1950s signalled huge increases in college attendance and interest in topics such as politics and sociology across Europe*

### The US Civil Rights Movement

The abolition of slavery by the Thirteenth Amendment in *1865 was a milestone moment; did not remotely* **end discrimination against African Americans**
Civil rights organisations including *the NAACP gained support in the 1950s, protesting* **Jim Crow laws and blatant segregation based on race** 
Civil Rights Act in 1964 viewed as *culmination of protests but did not end demand for***greater civil liberties; movement became inspiration across the world in 1960s**

### Protest of Vietnam War

Student protests began in 1963 but only *became violent following one against Dow Chemicals* **at the University of Wisconsin in October 1967**
This became a trend but garnered *worldwide attention on 4 May 1970 when* **the National Guard shot dead 4 Kent State students**
The Tet Offensive in January 1968 triggered mass protests across the US *playing a role in the decision by* **President Lyndon Johnson not to seek election**

## West Germany

Viewed as one of the first *post second world war instance of*  **civil unrest**
Influenced by the American protests, figures such as *Rudi Dutschke led student protests motivated partly by what Wegs referred to as* **atonement for submissiveness to authority during the war**
Failed to gain *widespread support* **possibly owing to a less sympathetic German public**

## Paris Protests - Origins

Charles de Gaulle-leg government *in France viewed as* **prosperous but bureaucratic**
Archaic university practices seen as symbols of overall society *Sorbonne as a example;* **still increase of over 300,000 students from 1950s to 1968**
Eventual protests came at a time *described by Wegs as of unquestioned prosperity* **and national grandeur in France**

### 22 March Movement

In response to resistance from university administration *protests were held and involved the formation of* **a group known as the 22 March Movement**
Main organiser was Daniel Cohn-Bendit *a French student born to* **German-Jewish parents**
Arrests of anti-Vietnam war committee in Nanterre *on 22 March including Cohn-Bendit*

#### Night of the Barricades and the General Strike

On May 3 students protested at the Sorbonne **broken up brutally by French police**
Mass march planned for a week later 10 May *sent into chaos hundreds of protests* **and police injured**
Public sympathy spread to student protests and *resulted in general workers strikes across France;* **13 May was viewed as a major day with millions of workers supporting and calling for own demands**

### De Gaulle Responds

De Gaulle responded first on television *then leaves France - visited French military generals for reassurance* **then reappeared on radio condemning the protests**
Announced new elections in June *spurs one million of his supporters to then rise up*

#### Protests end for now

June elections in France saw *a resounding victory for De Gaulle's Union for the New Republic party*
He resigned the following April following *a defeat in a referendum attempting to confirm* **his control**
Legacy lay in improved rights for workers *and the birth of a student movement around issues of* **women's rights and other freedoms**

## Czechoslovakia

Part of Austria Hungary empire - became independent after First World War - became under Soviet influence after WW2 *Antonin Novotny became secretary of the Communist Party and***leader in 1957, initially popular for his stances against Stalinism**
Economic reforms the main catalyst; Novotny *routinely criticised for* **command economy approach**
Desire amongst Slovaks for greater autonomy *also an influence; new Slovak leader since* **1963 Alexander Dubcek viewed as more reformative**

### Prague Spring

Both student and writer protests *had been dealt with harshly by Novotny regime* **former led to harsh treatment from police**
Novotny forced to resign following a *lack of support from the Slovaks and Soviet Union* **Dubcek took over in January 1968**
Ushered in several months of increased reforms and freedoms of the press *alongside Action Program promising greater civil rights and liberties across Czechoslovakia*


### Soviet Response

Warsaw Letter in July 1968 *requested affirmation and action from Dubcek to* **confirm Soviet control of country**
Dubcek reaffirmed commitment but viewed as *too passive and welcoming to* **other Communist leaders such as Tito**
Soviet invasion force arrived on 20 August and arrested Dubcek *eventually leading to new pro-Soviet leadership* **in Gustav Husak and Ludomir Strougal**

## Government of Ireland Act

Outbreak of war between Britain and Ireland in 1919 *put pressure on former to recognise independence in* **aftermath of First World War**
Government of Ireland Act 1920 *partitioned Ireland into two states* **North and South**
Created a Northern Irish state *dominated by Unionist majority*

### Special Powers Act 1922

Enacted in 1922 *in response to violence during Anglo-Irish War* **and Irish Civil War**
Allowed for internment without trial *arrest without warrant and* **lasted for 50 years until its repeal in 1972**
Was strongly biased against Nationalist minority as *RUC were predominantly a* **Unionist police force**

#### Campaign for Civil Rights

Discrimination in Housing, Employment and Education *continued from inception of NI state* **largely unabated until 1960s**
Gerrymandering a factor in local elections *hesitancy somewhat borne out of belief in* **temporary nature of state**
Calls for better civil rights for Catholic population *grew louder in early 1960s with inspiration* **from Civil Rights Movement in the US**

### Formation of NICRA

Campaign by campaign for Social Justice *and others in early 1960s* **struggled for support**
In 1967, NICRA formed as an umbrella group *with early committee members including* **Noel Harris (Communist part) and Billy McMillen (Belfast Official IRA)**
Meeting in Belfast in April 1967 *ratified organisation but would take* **18 months before NICRA became a household name**

## Operation Banner and Internment

Battle of the Bogside in August 1969 after *Apprentice Boys March resulted in Unionist government* **requesting British troops to queel riots**
Troops arrived and were welcomed as *peacekeepers in some quarters;* **importantly not in others**
Policies such as internment and the events of *Bloody Sunday in Derry effectively* **ended civil rights movement in Northern Ireland** 

### Other Protests

Protests by students in *Yugoslavia (largest in Belgrade) on 2-3 June 1968* **were suppressed by President Tito but some demands were granted**
Student demonstrations in March 1968 were beaten *by police in Warsaw which garnered some public support before* **universities were closed and thousands of students arrested**
Protests of spending for the 1968 Olympics turned violent on *2 October 1968 in Mexico City* **where several protestors were killed in clashes with the army**

## Conclusion

Each country different in tone *response and motivations for protests but within common themes such as* **prevelance of students and dissatisfaction with government policies**
These underappreciated trend's are *critical in understanding the development of modern European societies*
The increased interest in humanities and social sciences *in universities resulted in a continued questioning of* **state authority and bureaucracy throughout the twentieth century**

People didn't have time during the war to question governments and leaders, but cut to the 60s and so on when people can think more ideologically about their modern societies
