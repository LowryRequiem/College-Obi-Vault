## Virginia Woolf

Plot structure *the exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement* **In Woolf's work, alters this, exposition and rising action allocated a lot of time where as the denouement is given very little**

Loose to no plot *examine a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day, the mind receives a myriad impressions, trivial, fantastic, evanescent or engraved with the sharpness of steel* **not an extraordinary character, ordinary person looking at mark on the wall**

Feeling of wanting to focus on the ordinary mind, *sense of bombardment*
### Opening of Mark on the Wall

Stream of consciousness, *intensive exaugurated thoughts but of an ordinary mind in an ordinary day* **the mind receiving myriad impressions** even within this solitary position, the woman is receiving so many trivial and fantastical impressions

The focus of this story is *her ordinary mind*

First word *perhaps*, **defies the rules of the omniscient narrator associated with Victorian literature** Vague markers of time, fire, chrysanthemums, tea, cigarette = *all just lead to winter time*

### Apophenia

Deciphering patterns in *random images/perceiving meaningful connections between unrelated things*
Way of thinking of modernist art
#### Plot Subversion

The mark on the wall is left ultimately non-defined all through the narrators interior monologue *yet this non defined object serves as a starting point for a series of hypothetical and deductive conclusions which in turn serve as the basis for* **free associations as indirect and subjective evidence to locate and create a certain fictional reality**

the failure to identify this mark on the wall *creates the text* **once its identifies, it destroys the text, ending it** so finding the answer is not the aim of the story

**The non definition of the mark becomes the metaphor for the ontological insecurity of human existence**
### Modern life: Speed/ Blur/ Interruption

The violence of modern life *tearing you apart* **echoes Elliot and Pound** if one wants to compare life to anything, one must liken it to being blown through the Tube at fifty miles an hour landing at the other end without a single hairpin in ones hair..
#### Stream of Consciousness

To slip easily from one thing to another *without any sense of hostility or obstacle* **want to sink deeper and deeper, away from the surface with its hard separate facts**

#### Loss of Certainty

Why not simply go look at the mark?

**The inaccuracy of thought**

After all our civilisation, we still don't know
##### Knowledge

Knowledge *cannot be trusted* **everything is slippery, you can't know anything**
##### Anchor of Objects

With all this swirl of thoughts and perception *she holds onto something definite, something real* **worshipping reality, solidity, the personal world, proof of existence other than ours** can rely on the physical things around her
#### Solid Objects - Worshipping Solidity

A humble reverence for the counterbalancing and weigh of objects runs throughout the short fiction of these authors... *to fashion something in creation solid and significant from the scattered scraps*

## Conclusion

Everything's moving, falling, slipping, vanishing etc. *someone is standing over me and saying, I'm going out to buy a newspaper* **i don't see why we should have a snail on our wall**
Cursing the newspaper, the war is contextualised into the story *was the war in the story the whole time?*

How the war has affected those at home, being at her home in London the home is there

### Male Logic Vs Female Imagination

The masculine pov, *governs our lives, sets the standard* **illegitimate freedom**
Intrusion of male into female space, a room of ones own?
## In Conclusion

VW's characters defined by their thoughts rather than their actions
Modernism, relativism *subjectivity* **chaos of individual experience** 
Focus on *perception* **not plot**
*How readily our thoughts swarm upon a new subject*
Writing as a mark on the wall, *Plato's cave?* **Shadow cast on a wall**
Experience as *deciphering perceptions*

## Modernist Art as a *mark on the wall*

Apophenia *Elliot, constantly amalgamating disparate experiences* **focus on how we perceive very evident in** Mark on the Wall

### Fauvism / Imagism

Presentation of a simple image
An image that *presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time*

## In Conclusion

Language of art, music of poetry, *focus on perception*
Consideration of *relativity of time and space*
Drawing on unconscious, *dream imagery and* **stream of consciousness**
No **fixed meaning**
Flux of experience and perception reflective of modern age
