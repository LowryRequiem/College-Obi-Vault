![[6- Edna O Brien, The Rug.pdf]]

The Rug was an interesting short story about the fragility of hope. I found the overly descriptive anecdotal nature of the text to create a nostalgic aura around the characters, and moments of familiarity fuel this. *"She had a round, sallow face and a peculiarly uncertain, timid smile. The suspicion soon left her, and the smile came out' That was one of her happiest days; I remember it as I remember her unhappiest day to my knowledge - the day the bailiff came, a year later"* This moment highlights how close the narrator is to her mother and allows these characters to feel personal and real. The same technique is used to reinforce the despair felt when the rug is taken from the family. *"'We live and learn,' she said, as she undid her apron strings, out of habit, and then retied them slowly and methodically, making a tighter knot."* The final line of the story once again uses that sense of familiarity to reinforce the emotions of the characters and it allows the narrative to instil a final sense of hopelessness felt by both the characters and the reader.

Berghain by comparison comes across as a very raw and vivid text. The descriptions of both character and setting feels very exposing and visceral, which in tandem with the use of an unlikeable, abrasive main character builds up a tension throughout the text. The juxtaposition between the narrators firm and sure commentary on the events within the club and the rejection he is faced, reinforces theme of frustration which is delivered upon in the explosive exchange between characters in the final few pages.
