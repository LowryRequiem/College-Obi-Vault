# Cold War

The **Cold War** was a prolonged period of geopolitical tension and ideological rivalry between the **United States** and the **Soviet Union** that lasted from the end of World War II (1945) to the early 1990s. It was characterized by the following key aspects:

    - Emerged after World War II due to ideological differences, with the U.S. promoting democracy and capitalism, while the Soviet Union supported communism.
2. **Key Players**:
    
    - The United States (led by presidents like Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan).
    - The Soviet Union (led by leaders like Stalin, Khrushchev, and Gorbachev).
3. **Key Events**:
    
    - Formation of military alliances: NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) by the U.S. and its allies and the Warsaw Pact by the Soviet Union and its satellite states.

4. **End**:
    
    - The Cold War officially ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

    - U.S. President **John F. Kennedy** and Soviet Premier **Nikita Khrushchev**.
3. **Events**:
    
    - **Thirteen Days**: The crisis unfolded over a tense 13-day period in October 1962.
    - Kennedy imposed a naval blockade on Cuba to prevent further missile deliveries.
    - Both superpowers engaged in intense diplomacy, and the world held its breath, fearing a nuclear conflict.
4. **Resolution**:
    
    - Khrushchev eventually agreed to remove the missiles from Cuba, and Kennedy pledged not to invade the island.
5. **Significance**:
    
    - The Cuban Missile Crisis is considered the closest the world came to a full-scale nuclear war during the Cold War. It led to increased communication between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to avoid future crises.
