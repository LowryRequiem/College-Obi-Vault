# Class Notes

## Intro

Heart of Darkness *modernism* **narrative structure, vision and knowledge, language, words , meaning**
In relation to *Empire* **representations of Africans** critique of the text in regards to racism

Conrad *born in Ukraine* **of polish descent, settled in England 1895** writes in English
Merchant seaman
Trip to Congo 1890 *witnessed* the **scramble for Africa**

The Congo under *Leopold* **the Belgium king**
Focus on getting ivory *the money associated with it* **rubber plantations** natural resources being exploited and extracted

Contemporary relevance *atrocity / human rights abuses*

*"Conrad...realised long before others that darkness had a heart, and the heart had darkness"*

Modernist novel recap *reality and its truth had gone inward* **emphasis on consciousness and flow of reflections. Flawed, impressionistic narrators, apparent truths**

## Modernism in Heart of Darkness

Complex narrative structure
emphasis on *perspective* **questioning ability of language to convey meaning**

The way words and meanings are used *implies there are double meanings and irony to them*

**Fixed truths**

### Narrative Structure

Duel narrative *outer narrator, unnamed* **Marlow's companion on the Nellie**
*Marlow and his story of the Congo*

Effect of duel narrative *Marlow's story of Africa framed by English setting*

Outer narrator *more in favour about empire, pro-imperialist* **"what greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth"**

Marlow *more ironic* **eg. Roman Britain, "what saves us is efficiency...but these chaps were not much account, really...it was just robbery with violence"** Distinguish what was done then versus what's happening in the present *irony following Marlow throughout the text*

### Marlow as narrator, Irony and ambiguity

Ironies, *the Freslevan anecdote* **glorious affair**

Ambiguities, *the silent wilderness...struck me like something great and invincible, like evil or truth* **funny to equate the two, evil and truth, putting them on the same level as one another, they're both great and invincible**

### Effect of Marlow's narration

Certainties undercut as readers while we're reading *makes us think about questions like what is evil and good, whose truths we believe* **certainties of imperial ideology**

Leaves questions open ended, *Marlow very hesitant as a narrator* **sets a scene, setting an atmosphere, uncertainties captured** use of … , shows his not quite sure of what he's seen, trying to make sense of

### Vision and knowledge

Motif of vision throughout the text *darkness*

Emphasis on difficulties in seeing *images of mist, fog, haze* 
Questions of perspective and *how we see* **few mentions of binoculars used, how perspective changes**

### Impressionism

Emphasis on perception, *perspective changing what you see*
Priority is not what all men know **but what does one individual see**

*Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end*

## Delayed Decoding

Marlow describes what he has perceived *without explaining what it really was* **or what it really meant**
Story is being told with hindsight, *being described as if he was in the middle of it*

While attacked on steamer, *sticks, little sticks, were flying about - thick!""* **later concludes these are arrows**
*a long cane* **later realised it is a spear, he has been speared, L**

Delayed sense of *confusion* **difficult to get our bearings as Marlows struggled to get his straight away**

### Questions of knowledge

What we know *depends on our perspective*

Binoculars, *same effect as previous explanation* **binoculars reveal something shocking to Marlow and the reader** the use of the binoculars suggesting how Marlow is happening to almost reset or *re-understand what's in front of him*

This builds *anxiety*

### Language, words, meaning

Words *fail to communicate meaning*
Difficulty for Marlow to convey what he has seen
*No it is impossible, it is impossible to convey the life sensation of any given epoch of ones existence - that which makes its truth its meaning its subtle and penetrating essence.... We live as we dream, alone*

Distortions of language *in order to hide the truth*
*brickmaker* **has never made a brick**

Language shaped by those in power, 
*Rebels! What would be the next definition I was to hear? These rebellious heads looked very subdued on their sticks*

### Written language

The traveller's hut, *message left thats hard to decipher with an illegible signature* **sense of written language almost being like a code**

Book left behind, *illegible notes or ciphers* **nvm he's just writing in Russian** language misleading you and not acting as a form of communication

Contrast *instruction manual supposed to convey information clearly*

## Effect of Conrad's techniques

All lead to *uncertainty of interpretation* **which is at odds with the plot itself**

Emphasis on how much a man cannot know, *and difficulty of sharing knowledge with others*

Truth, knowledge, shared certainties *called into question*

## Heart of Darkness and Empire

Apocalypse Now *based off Heart of Darkness*

Marlow's journey into the Congo via steamboat in search of Kurt's, *well renowned and praised harvester of ivory* **after finding Kurt's, his descent from within the Heart of Darkness**

European belief in *civilizing missions*
White Mans Burden *spread knowledge and enlightenment* **shine a light on the dark places of the earth**

Binary *hierarchical oppositions* **light and dark, civilisation and savagery, good and evil**

Soap ad, 'white mans role', *bringing soap to 'clean up the colonies'* 

Heart of Darkness, *critiques these ideologies* i.e. **characters in Heart of Darkness dressed in white but surrounded by death decay and squaller** as if the white clothes is meant to rise the character above it *white man bringing order, amidst disorder*

### Critique of Imperial project

HoD *reveals brutality, waste, greed, amorality of white mans 'civilizing'* mission in Africa **Strongly condemns white characters - the manager, the pilgrims, the Eldorado Exploration expeditions (burglars breaking into a safe)**

Three stations and station chiefs *claims of higher purpose vs reality of how stations operate* **Each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things...full of death and decay**

Kurtz idealism *but contrast between his ideals and his failure*

### European Hollow Men

Kurtz appears to be a *hollow sham*
The agent; *it seemed to me that if I tried I could poke my forefinger through him and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt* **these men are easily corrupted**

Kurtz; *there was something wanting in him...he was hollow at the core* **why does Kurtz get tempted for power within this station, why is he tempted by that** there's something wanting in him, he's hollow to start with

Conrad *criticizing the scramble for Africa* **and portray a set of illusions set up around it**

### Critiques of Conrad

Chinua Achebe - *Joseph Conrad was a thoroughgoing racist*

*Conrad saw and condemned the evil of imperial exploitation but was strangely unaware of the racism on which it sharpened its iron tooth* **Conrad aware of the Imperial exploitation but not aware to the racism**

Reinforces racist stereotypes of Africans as *savage and primitive*
Use of racist language, *grotesque, ugly, frenzy* **dehumanizes Africa and Africans**

Mimic man vs authentic savage, *the fireman...was an improved specimen... to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs* **when Africans are in their own spehre, Conrad is admiring them, when they encroach on the 'white man' stereotypes they are suddenly critiqued**

Who gets to speak, *African characters seen wholly through European eyes* **Don't get to speak back, their language presented as incomprehensible**

Only two exceptions, cannibal and managers boy, *not given the same status as the European characters*

#### Representation of African Jungle

Death, disease, decay; *in and out of rivers, streams of death in life, whose banks were rotting into mud, whose waters, thickened into slime, invaded the contorted mangroves*

Associations with *magic and the occult* **bewitched by the wilderness**

How problematic is it that a book such as Heart of Darkness is *creating such an image of Africa in the West*

### Defence of Conrad

Hunt Hawkins; *Kurtz' corruption comes not from Africans but from Europe and from Kurtz himself...whole novel is a critique where Kurtz represents the European man who has corrupted the tribe*

### Ending of the novel and return to Europe

Imagery of *darkness and death* **Brussels, the sepulchral city**
If Africa is the Heart of Darkness, death and decay *at the end of the novel, this imagery gets transferred back to Europe, Marlow see's the heart of darkness within Europe itself*

Europe as the *Heart of Darkness?*

With every word spoken the room was growing darker...

### To Sum Up

Conrad is certainly of his time, many of his depictions are racist, in the end, *the heart of darkness returns to Brussels and has spread to the Congo itself*

Conrad's novel questions the *confident certainties of Imperialism*
His strongest *is of white men* **but also true that he utilises racist discourse**

**More interested in the European mind than in Africans themselves**

Also worth thinking of *his treatment of women as characters*
Most characters are male, *women with some interesting roles* **Marlow's aunt sends him on his way, glimpses of African woman who is Kurtz mistress, we meet Kurtz fiancé in Europe**

The *intended / African woman* **binary opposites**

The intended is naïve and unknowing, not present, African woman not presented as deluded like the intended woman is *European delusion*

Women as symbol *painting at Kurtz* **blindfolded woman holding a torch, i.e. justice, women having this symbolic value in the text rather than being characters or being relevant to the plot, not integrated, symbolic value**

Masculine narrative *compare to Woolf and Hurston*
