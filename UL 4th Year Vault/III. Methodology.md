# Research Methodology for Analyzing Horror Elements in Gothic Texts

#### **1. Literature Review**

- **Review of Gothic Literature**: Begin by conducting a comprehensive literature review to understand the historical context and evolution of Gothic literature. Identify key themes, tropes, and characteristics commonly associated with Gothic fiction.
    
- **Review of Selected Texts**: Review each of the selected texts ("Vampyre," "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," "Bloodborne," and "House of Leaves") to identify critical analyses, scholarly articles, and existing research related to the horror elements present in these works.
    

#### **2. Textual Analysis**

- **Close Reading**: Perform a close reading of each text, paying special attention to passages, scenes, or chapters that evoke feelings of horror. Note specific language, imagery, and narrative techniques used to create suspense, fear, and unease.
    
- **Character Analysis**: Analyze the characters in each text, with a focus on how their traits, actions, and transformations contribute to the horror elements. Consider their dual natures, moral ambiguity, and psychological aspects.
    
- **Setting and Atmosphere**: Investigate the settings and atmospheres created in the texts. Examine how descriptions of locations, architecture, and weather contribute to the overall sense of dread and suspense.
    

#### **3. Comparative Analysis**

- **Identify Commonalities and Differences**: Compare and contrast the horror elements across the selected texts. Identify common themes, motifs, and techniques used by different authors and explore how they are adapted or modified in each work.
    
- **Cultural and Historical Context**: Consider the cultural and historical contexts in which these texts were written. Analyze how societal norms, anxieties, and fears of the time influenced the portrayal of horror.
    

#### **4. Interdisciplinary Approach**

- **Psychological Analysis**: Employ psychological theories to analyze the characters' psyches, motivations, and the impact of their actions on the narrative's horror elements.
    
- **Visual Analysis (for "Bloodborne")**: If analyzing "Bloodborne," incorporate visual analysis techniques to explore the game's art and design elements that contribute to the horror experience.
    
- **Narrative Structure (for "House of Leaves")**: For "House of Leaves," examine the unconventional narrative structure and its effect on the reader's sense of horror and disorientation.
    

#### **5. Reader Response and Reception**

- **Reader Reception**: Investigate how readers and critics have responded to these texts over time. Analyze reviews, fan discussions, and critical reception to understand how horror elements are perceived and interpreted.
    
- **Reader Experience**: Consider the reader's emotional and psychological experience while engaging with these texts. Analyze reader reactions and interpretations.
    

#### **6. Theoretical Framework**

- **Apply Literary Theories**: Utilize relevant literary theories such as psychoanalysis, Gothic theory, and narrative theory to provide a theoretical framework for your analysis.

#### **7. Data Collection and Documentation**

- **Data Collection**: Collect textual evidence, quotes, and excerpts that support your analysis. Organize this data systematically for reference.
    
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of sources, references, and citations following an appropriate academic style guide (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago).
    

#### **8. Writing and Analysis**

- **Thematic Analysis**: Organize your analysis thematically, addressing various aspects of horror, including fear, suspense, moral ambiguity, and transformation.
    
- **Critical Interpretation**: Offer your critical interpretation of how these elements contribute to the overall horror experience in the selected texts.
    

#### **9. Conclusion and Implications**

- **Summarize Findings**: Summarize your research findings, highlighting the key elements of horror in each text.
    
- **Implications**: Discuss the implications of your analysis, such as how the portrayal of horror elements may reflect cultural or psychological anxieties.


# Data Collection Plan

### **[[Primary Source Data]]**

For the primary source texts I have chosen, rereads, active note taking and sampling will be used to gather examples of data which are relevant to everything listed prior to this point. 

*Gathering and collecting this data will be a core step in formatting the thesis*

### **[[Secondary Source Data]]**

For secondary sources, further research by me assisted by Chatgpt will lead to what articles and journals I will use to support the data already collected.

*Also the list of horror literature which Jack Fennell has sent already*

# Criteria for [[Psychological Data]] 

After gathering and sorting the data from primary and secondary sources *I will decide on and structure which psychological theories are relevant to the data collected* **in addition to what ones are talked about in the collected secondary sources**
