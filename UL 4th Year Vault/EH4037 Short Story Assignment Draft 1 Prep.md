# Brief Summary

Suddenly, one day in early 2023, all power goes out in Ireland. Anything electric ceases to work, no communications are received from the outside and anyone who leaves the country has yet to come back.

Over the first year of this break, society falls into chaos and slowly adapts itself with large cities becoming dead zones of looters and militia whereas small rural communities band together and focus on maintaining the likes of farming for survival. Towns become dependant on each other and society completely shifts.

The protagonist is a youth who is troubled by the whole scenario, representing a technology reliant generation, the adaptation has wrung him mentally as he disassociates his mental state with the technological world which has passed by, and now his physical state remains. In this way he becomes detached from the world, viewing the new post power out world as a phenomenon that surrounds him rather than one he's in.

The short story follows him as he finds a functioning camera, and despite it's worth and value in this power out economy, he decides to secretly keep it to film what society is now like. This however, is later revealed to be a spell of madness as the camera is in fact broken and represents the protagonist himself, a shell of a device which lost its function and purpose with the power outage.
