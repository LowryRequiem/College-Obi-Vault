# First thoughts

This story is about literary interpretation and the complexity of human consciousness

This is done in tandem as the narrator almost forces the reader to interpret something where there is nothing

The experience of the reader reading the text mirrors that of the narrator contemplating the mark on the wall

Intertextuality with the human mind

The tease of a meaning of war suggests an important idea that isn't there - interpolating that sometimes behind things of significance is actually the complexity of humans

There is talk of legacy and significance, and the way its talked about suggests the idea that ultimately all there is in legacy is the human thought which lingers on it for years to come - especially as this text prompts exploration of what we see SIGNIFICANT 

Recognising the mark is IRRELEVANT - already painted over by men - then the mark is defined by the man

Thought spiral, thought process

Poetic Philosophy

This invites complex human thought and embraces vagueness - finding a definitive answer is not the point! Trying to make sense of things is not the point! All we can do is *comprehend* what is already there - this invites the complex question of the human experience and questioning the legacy of everything that's led to this point
# Structure

**Discuss the significance of the ‘plot-less’ nature of Virginia Woolf’s short story, ‘The Mark on the Wall’.**
## 1700 - 1800 Words

P1 - *Intro* - The plot-less nature challenges our comprehension of narrative interpretation and thus opens the discussion of the complexity of human consciousness
- Invite people in to Mark on the Wall and what its about
- Argue that its a commentary on narrative interpretation and thus human consciousness
- Talk about how the existence of this text alone breaks from usual narrative structure and exposes the fragility of our comprehension over time

P2 - *Style* - The writing style is that of stream of consciousness and as such is able to explore complex ideas otherwise impossible - it allows immersion and as such explores the fragmented nature of human cognition

**What it is about. The use of it and the vaguness of the mark / snail decieves the reader with the same thing which spurred such linguiostic and literary thought in the first place. frustration. the marks definiton is a reading lure, having built up an interpretation based on what is unsaid - hidden not yet actualized signifieds - an encounter with life itself? the modernest reflection that a mirror isnt just a reflection but infinite. infinite richness of humanity as metaphorized not by definiton but its potentially unstable nature as a referent - illusion of significance. nothing is proved, nothing is known**

P3 - *The Mark itself, the strive for meaning* - how Woolf invites the want to discover what the mark is, yet denies it through elaborate exploration of themes and contexts - challenges traditional notions of significance and floats between them all almost to ironically say it could be anything but also couldn't - fragility of human life / mind **Proper stuff for fiction mark on wall and other short fiction - mark on the wall captivates readers with an unpropitious motifs - readers find daydreams or their surroundings more appealing than printed words - capviated by things which lack identity, definition, or apparant significance - the text itself is liberating as the narrator can find themselves slipping between thoughts not constrained by society and what we should be thinking about**

P4 - *Subjectivity* - So far, the text has been through the scope of obvious objectivity trying to find out what exactly the mark on the wall is - themes of feminism, war - THESE ARE THE THINGS AFFECTED THE NARRATOR - yet it explores so much more than that 

**Gendered spaces and female resistance**

**space is never a neutral emptiness, but a web of cultural, social and ideological relations which condition those individuals that inhabit them. Gender and space are constructed as mutually dependant categories. discrimination between the public sphere, associated with masculinity, and the private or domestic sphere, generall conceived of as female. hierarchical and supports an ideology that is both patriarchal and capitalist at heart** 

P5 - *Intertextuality with the human mind* - so far the entire text has been about making sense of the mark through the human mind, and what is the mark? well it can be anything and it can be nothing - in this current state its comprehension is completely up to the narrator. Similarly, making sense of the text itself, is purely through interpretation of the reader - and this will only change in time as our eyes open to more themes and more significant events and people decide what is significant in the world

**A cognitive sketch - cognitive-conceptual analysis, the unreality of reality as conventionally defined, breaks in tradition that push limits, modernist manifesto. time and motion shown to be relative, amibguity of closure, how objects can interfere and interact with thought, relation between imagination and fact, how imnagination is often anchored to a physical detail or solid object**

P6 - *Conclusion* - everything so far make sense of it - Woolfs other works - break from usual narrative structure exposes the real fragility of our comprehension of texts and therefore themes and subject matter and exposes how vulnerable and primal self-reflection and contemplation is
