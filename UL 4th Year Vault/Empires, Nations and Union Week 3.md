### A. Key Events Leading to the Culmination
- **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand:** In 1914, the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne triggered the war.
- **Alliance Systems:** Europe was divided into two major alliances: the Allies (France, Britain, Russia) and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire).
- **Trench Warfare:** The war was characterized by brutal trench warfare on the Western Front, resulting in a stalemate for several years.

### B. U.S. Entry into the War

  - Economic hardships, food shortages, and internal dissent.

  - It ended the state of war but left many resentments and economic hardships in Germany.
  - The "stab-in-the-back" myth emerged, blaming politicians for Germany's defeat.
- The treaty's harsh terms contributed to economic hardships in Germany, setting the stage for future conflicts.

## IV. Conclusion

- While the treaty aimed to prevent future wars, its terms contributed to instability and resentment in Germany, ultimately paving the way for World War II.

|Full transcription of text follows:  <br>  <br>emcgee_0037_0001  <br>  <br>Springfield Ohio. [September] 26, 1920 Dear Friend of William,- I feel very much like an intruder stepping on sacred and hallowed ground. I am only a public school teacher, that was a war-time nurse and am now teaching in [Springfield] living with Mr. and Mrs. Moore. I came here six wks. after this terrible accident.  <br>  <br>emcgee_0037_0002  <br>  <br>Mrs. Moore asked me to write for her, you understand. Your letter was most beautiful and I read it to Mrs. Moore. She asks you to please write to her any little incidents or happenings in France that her son was interested or acquainted with. She surely was a wonder-ful mother for she surely had three wonderful sons. Two of her sons live near by and show their greatness in the way they treat their mother and their loving wives. I only wish you knew them. Write please to Mrs. Moore and she will answer herself. She can never forget you for your kindness to her beloved son. He never was well since he came home. His mother believes that it would not have been long until he would have had to keep his room. He look well, but his lungs were almost destroyed by gas. Oh! I cannot tell you how I feel, I am so sympathetic I can see how sad you are at these dear losses. You were there, you saw what the war did for our dear boys, and you.  <br>  <br>emcgee_0038_0003  <br>  <br>(Pardon me for saying "Bill" but that is his mother's pet name for him) Yes, My dear,- "Bill" receive the poem written by the boy who died in France. How, I wish I had known "Bill" (as every body calls him) for he was a fine gentleman and every one speaks well of him. The children in the schools knew and loved him He was a star athlete and played on one of the best H. S. football teams in the state. How he is missed (For Mother Moore) I am, Miss Martha Mohler. Kindly write again Sincerely Mrs. Moore.  <br>  <br>From the service of Eleanor McGee, American Red Cross nurse at Base Hospital # 23 "The Nouvel" located in Vittel, Vosges, France from 1918-1919 (?).|

## Analysis

This source gives insight into the ordinary peoples response to the war, and responses to loved ones being involved in the war. The writer of the letter, Miss Martha Mohler writes on the behalf of a Mrs. Moore, and discusses her sons who were involved in the war. They refer to it all as a terrible accident and write of how the boys' lungs were "destroyed by gas". Where they write, "you were there, you saw what the war did for our dear boys", it greatly shows how the war is viewed as devastation and how's its consequences were felt internationally and close to home.  

In relation to the question of why it became known as the first world war, this letter presents an important aspect of how the effects of the war were felt across the world. With those detached from the war seeing the direct consequences of it through the losses of loved ones and family.
