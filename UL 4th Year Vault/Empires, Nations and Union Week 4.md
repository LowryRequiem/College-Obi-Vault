## Fascism

Broadly defined as *an authoritarian regime that suppresses opposition* **and strongly opposes Marxism** Strong opposition to *socialism*
Numerous factors that *influence the rise of Fascism*
	- Inflation *and the Economy*
	- Nationalism *and identity*
	- Fear *of Socialism*
	- Propaganda *and Charismatic Leadership*

## Economics of Europe

German reparations *devastated German economy which had a ripple effect* **hyperinflation caused by printing more money (German mark value plummeted to be worth less than paper by 1924**
US economy *became dominant as Britain incurred huge debts* **many economies including US became protectionist in aftermath of the war**

Began ass sharp decline on *last 10 days or so of October* **markets had collapsed beyond repair, everyone started selling** everyone selling at the same time = nobody's buying = values collapse

Precipitated Great Depression *that devasted the world economy* **for majority of the 1930s**

## The Fighting Does Not Stop

End of the war *did not end the fighting in Europe*
Ethnic and Ideological Wars broke out in *Russia, Poland, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Turkey 1919-23* **as a result of promised land or demand for greater autonomy**
Colonial conflict led to *independence wars in Egypt and Ireland* **as well as a war between Greece and Turkey that continued to destabilise Europe and the empires**

## The Red Menace

Fear of the spread of *socialism was utilised as propaganda in Germany and Italy* **to great effect to boost support for Fascism**
Less successful in Britain, US and France as *socialist movements struggled for support and* **were less revolutionary in ideology**
Socialism was viewed as a threat to capitalism *but could not be pointed to as only factor* **that caused irse in Fascist support (Belgium as counter example)**
Belgium saw significant rise in socialism *despite propaganda use*

### Propaganda and Leadership

Another factor was the *charisma and effective use of propaganda in both Germany and Italy* **with Hitler and Mussolini as guiding lights**
Certainly it had impact on *heightening the threat of socialism and* **unifying support against ethnic minorities**
Similarly, Fascism in France had *well spoken and charismatic leadership in Francois de la Rocque and Jacques Doriot* **but still failed to garner and sizable support**

## Antisemitism

Has existed for over two thousand years *but seemed to escalate in period 1899-1939* **particularly in Western societies**
Factors that have been pointed to for *this phenomenon include;*
	- *The impact of Modernisation and* **social mobility**
	- **Scapegoat theory**
	- *Multifaceted and detailed prejudice* **against Jews**

# Conclusion

Several factors impacted *the development of Fascist ideology* **in Europe 1919-39**
These included the *fear of socialism, economic hardship and the use of propaganda* **as well as the scapegoating of ethnic minorities including Jews**
Importantly, nuances meant that Fascism only spread to *specific countries and rose* **at different stages throughout the twenty years**

### Mock Chapter Summary

# Chapter 5: Women in Europe between the Wars: A Culture of Contradictions

_By Dr. Emily Reynolds, Historian_

## Introduction

The interwar period in Europe was a time of significant cultural upheaval. As the continent struggled to recover from the devastation of World War I, women found themselves at the nexus of profound contradictions. This chapter explores the multifaceted roles and experiences of women during this tumultuous era, shedding light on the complexities that defined their lives.

## The Flapper Phenomenon: Breaking Free from Tradition

### Embracing Liberation

The "flapper" emerged as a symbol of female liberation during the interwar years. These young women, characterized by their short hair, knee-length dresses, and love for jazz music, challenged traditional gender norms. They embraced social and sexual freedom, flaunting their independence through their fashion and behavior.

### Economic Empowerment

Many women joined the workforce during this period, driven by economic necessity. They took on jobs traditionally reserved for men, such as factory work and clerical positions. This economic empowerment granted them a newfound sense of autonomy and financial independence.

## Traditionalism Persists: The Role of Motherhood

### The Cult of Motherhood

Despite the surge in independence and modernity, traditional notions of motherhood remained deeply ingrained in European societies. Women were still expected to prioritize their roles as mothers and homemakers. The idealized image of the nurturing, self-sacrificing mother persisted.

#### Source

### Pronatalism and Population Concerns

Governments in many European countries actively promoted motherhood as a patriotic duty, encouraging women to have more children to counter population decline. Pronatalist policies, such as financial incentives for large families, reinforced the traditional role of women as childbearers.

## The Paradox of Politics: Women's Suffrage and Limited Rights

### Gains in Suffrage

The interwar years also witnessed significant strides in women's political participation. Several European countries granted women the right to vote during this period, marking a historic victory for the suffrage movement.

#### Source

- **Pankhurst, E. (1928). My Own Story. Harper & Brothers.**

### Unequal Citizenship

However, even with the right to vote, women continued to face legal and societal barriers. Discrimination and unequal treatment persisted, preventing women from fully participating in the political sphere.

## Conclusion

The interwar period in Europe was a time of remarkable contradictions for women. While some embraced newfound freedoms and challenged traditional roles, others remained bound by the enduring expectations of motherhood and domesticity. Political progress was made, but women still faced substantial barriers. Understanding these contradictions is essential for appreciating the complexity of women's experiences during this transformative era.

In the next chapter, we will delve into the impact of World War II on the status and roles of women in Europe, exploring how it both reinforced and reshaped their place in society.

# Tutorial

## Tutorial Question

*What do you believe was the main cause(s) for the rise in Fascist ideology in the interwar period?*

I believe the consequences of the war led to a ruptured movement of change across Europe. There are many factors to account for, the lasting impacts of the war had left mass casualties and economic damage which would allow room for new ideologies such as fascism to becoming appealing to the public.. There was an increase in political turmoil throughout this period, caused by many fissures within nations. Such as the overthrowing of the Romanov dynasty and establishment of a communist government in Russia, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and many other cases of countries gaining independence or struggling for independence. Alongside this, the war had inspired a surge of nationalism across Europe which in combination with the use of propaganda led to the perfect circumstance to introduce a new ideology such as Fascism, especially when it acted as an alternative to communism which was beginning to spread.
