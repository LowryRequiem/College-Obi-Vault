First World War *exacerbated concerns in the Duma over* **lack of reforms and general negligence**
Protests in March 1917, placed *pressure on Nicholas to abdicate the throne which he eventually agreed* **and a Provisional Government was established led by Georgy Lvov**

## Fascism

Broadly defined as *an authoritarian regime that suppresses opposition* **and strongly opposes Marxism** Strong opposition to *socialism*
Numerous factors that *influence the rise of Fascism*
	- Inflation *and the Economy*
	- Nationalism *and identity*
	- Fear *of Socialism*
	- Propaganda *and Charismatic Leadership*

## Economics of Europe

German reparations *devastated German economy which had a ripple effect* **hyperinflation caused by printing more money (German mark value plummeted to be worth less than paper by 1924**
US economy *became dominant as Britain incurred huge debts* **many economies including US became protectionist in aftermath of the war**

Speculation and inflation had been *major causes of financial bubble that* **that preceded the events of October 1929**
Began ass sharp decline on *last 10 days or so of October* **markets had collapsed beyond repair, everyone started selling** everyone selling at the same time = nobody's buying = values collapse

Precipitated Great Depression *that devasted the world economy* **for majority of the 1930s**

## The Fighting Does Not Stop

End of the war *did not end the fighting in Europe*
Ethnic and Ideological Wars broke out in *Russia, Poland, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Turkey 1919-23* **as a result of promised land or demand for greater autonomy**
Colonial conflict led to *independence wars in Egypt and Ireland* **as well as a war between Greece and Turkey that continued to destabilise Europe and the empires**

## The Red Menace

Fear of the spread of *socialism was utilised as propaganda in Germany and Italy* **to great effect to boost support for Fascism**
Less successful in Britain, US and France as *socialist movements struggled for support and* **were less revolutionary in ideology**
Socialism was viewed as a threat to capitalism *but could not be pointed to as only factor* **that caused irse in Fascist support (Belgium as counter example)**
Belgium saw significant rise in socialism *despite propaganda use*

### Propaganda and Leadership

Another factor was the *charisma and effective use of propaganda in both Germany and Italy* **with Hitler and Mussolini as guiding lights**
Certainly it had impact on *heightening the threat of socialism and* **unifying support against ethnic minorities**
Similarly, Fascism in France had *well spoken and charismatic leadership in Francois de la Rocque and Jacques Doriot* **but still failed to garner and sizable support**

## Antisemitism

Has existed for over two thousand years *but seemed to escalate in period 1899-1939* **particularly in Western societies**
Factors that have been pointed to for *this phenomenon include;*
	- *The impact of Modernisation and* **social mobility**
	- **Scapegoat theory**
	- *Multifaceted and detailed prejudice* **against Jews**

# Conclusion

Several factors impacted *the development of Fascist ideology* **in Europe 1919-39**
These included the *fear of socialism, economic hardship and the use of propaganda* **as well as the scapegoating of ethnic minorities including Jews**
