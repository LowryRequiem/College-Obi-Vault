# Reading Report

I found Breakfast Wine by Kevin Barry very intriguing in how it described its setting and utilised that in crafting the characters, their interactions and the themes of the text. The descriptions of the pub gives a sense of routine, both to the setting and the characters within it. This allows the setting to act as a focal point to explores the themes and characters and is done so narratively through their dialogue and their interactions with the pub as they sit on the high stools and drink. I found this made the text very readable and immersive throughout and allowed for a satisfying conclusion.

Nirvana by Adam Johnson was an unexpectedly bizarre but fascinating text. I found how the setting and characters were described slowly delivered information about the world while also capturing the themes and narrative similarly to Breakfast Wine but in a completely different context.
